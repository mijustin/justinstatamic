# SmartyPants Typographer Parser Class
#
# Note: Currently the implementation resides in the temporary class
# \michelf\_SmartyPantsTypographer_TmpImpl (in the same file as
# \michelf\SmartyPants). This makes it easier to propagate the changes between
# the three different packaging styles of PHP SmartyPants. Once this issue is
# resolved, the _SmartyPantsTypographer_TmpImpl class will disappear and this
# one will contain the code.
#
use \michelf\SmartyPants;

class SmartyPantsTypographer extends \michelf\_SmartyPantsTypographer_TmpImpl {

	### Parser Implementation ###

	# Temporarily, the implemenation is in the _SmartyPantsTypographer_TmpImpl
	# class. See note above.
