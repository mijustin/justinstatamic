<p align="center">Introducing something new, just for JFDI members: <em>The Week of Hustle</em></p>
<p align="center"><img src="hustle.jpg" alt="Welcome to the hustle." width="300" height="310" border="0" /></p>
<p>Hey 
  <mymailout:listmember field="firstname" default=""  format="{0}" />
,</p>
<p>Do you want to release more stuff? Of course! We all do (that's a big reason we're in JFDI).</p>
<p>The challenge is that weeks can go by without us doing anything. We procrastinate. We get busy. We're unfocused.</p>
<blockquote><em>I want to get more things out there in general, so anything that forces me to get something shipped quickly is a good thing.</em><footer> - Jacob W</footer></blockquote>
<p>Next Saturday, November 9th, I'll be opening registration for the <em>Week of Hustle</em>. This is a week-long email bootcamp <strong>just for JFDI members</strong>. Best of all: it's included in your monthly membership.</p>
<p><strong>This 7 day bootcamp is designed to help you build a product in 1 week.
</strong>
<p>Every day, you'll get a challenge by email. You'll complete the challenge, and then report back (to keep you accountable).</p>
<p>The bootcamp is a perfect fit if you're:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Looking to build a small product in 1 week</li>
  <li>Looking to finish a product you've alreay started, but are stagnating on.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a week,  you'll have worked hard, and shipped something! <a href="http://jordanphoenix.quora.com/A-Deep-Thought-From-The-Universe">Life's too short to let any more weeks slip by</a>.</p>
<p>Are you in?</p>
<p>Remember: this is going to require at least a few hours of work each day. Check your calendar: make sure you can seriously commit  before signing up.</p>
<p>I'll send out the registration link early in the morning this coming Saturday (November 9th). Once you sign-up you'll receive your first email automatically. Each day, we'll discuss what we did <a href="http://jfdi.bz/groups/week-of-hustle/">on the <em>Week of Hustle </em>discussion group on JFDI</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br>
  Justin Jackson
</p>
<p>PS: this bootcamp is for people who have already built an audience, and started to identify their pain points. If you haven't done that yet, stay tuned for the <em>Build an Audience</em> bootcamp.</p>
