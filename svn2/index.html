    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">You need someone who can jump right in</h2>
    With an increasing number of email requests, you need a support person who can respond quickly without making mistakes.  You also don't have a lot of time for training.  I can get started right away:
      <blockquote>&ldquo;Not only does Justin work with speed and accuracy, he has tremendous integrity and character.&quot; - Gregg Oldring, Mailout Interactive</blockquote></div></td>
    <td width="475"><div class="box"><img src="02.jpg" width="445" height="100" alt="I'm a team player"><h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">You need a team player and a problem solver</h2>
The strength of 37signals is your unique and talented team.  Anyone you hire should  be able to partner with the rest of the staff and help create great experiences for customers:
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Justin has an outstanding work ethic. He is always thinking critically and creatively and is a valuable asset to any team.&quot; - Bob Perkins, Provincial Director, Young Life</blockquote>

    <div style="margin: 5px 5px 5px 0; padding:5px; background-color:#000; color:#FFF; display:block; width:auto;">Why I want to work in support</div>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">I understand support: I treat customers like human beings.</h2>
    I like working with people, and I care about their user experience. On the phone, in-person and in an email <strong>I am cheerful, patient and clear</strong>. My customers think so too:
    <blockquote>"Justin has assisted me numerous times with my email software issues. He is very quick to identify problems, and immediately solves them each time. I am pleased to recommend him and his company to anyone..." - <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=23962704&trk=tab_pro#recommendations">Sunshine Davis</a></blockquote>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">I'm good at helping people get things done.</h2>
    <div>Customers contact support because they've hit a roadblock. What do they want? <strong>To get back to work as quickly as possible.</strong> It's the job of a support person to do this by giving them a clear solution; enabling the customer to return to their task.</div>
    <div style="margin-top:10px;">Currently, per day, I answer <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/svn/emails.jpg">22 support emails</a>; but I have the ability to answer many more (75-100 is achievable for me). I know you're thinking about adding phone support: right now I answer about 10 customer calls a day. To enhance my support work, I use tools like <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a>, <a href="http://jingproject.com/">Jing</a>, <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm">Screenflow</a> and, naturally,<strong> Basecamp</strong> and <strong>Highrise</strong>.</div>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">I like to write. I like to teach.</h2>
    I share lessons passionately through <a href="http://blog.mailoutinteractive.com/author/Justin.aspx">blog posts</a>, <a href="http://www.justin.tv/mailoutinteractive/b/265576607?exported=true#r=5EUhOac~&s=li">workshops</a>, <a href="http://www.mailoutinteractive.com/sc/flash/step3a_addimages.html">screencasts</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mijustin/status/12294678407">Twitter updates</a>, and conversations.  I have experience in training and supporting a  <strong>variety of users in a web app environment</strong>.    
    Many of these are regular business users outside of the &quot;web&quot; world.</div>

      <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">I like your approach; I want to grow with you.</h2>
When I first read <em>Getting Real</em>, I kept saying
        &quot;<strong><em>Yes! This makes so much sense</em></strong>!&quot; I love your approach to work, design, and doing things better. <strong>I want to be on the front lines:</strong> learning and growing your business with you, and developing the insights that will be a part of the next edition of <em>ReWork</em>!
        <p>I really enjoyed my time with your team in Chicago, and left feeling like I would fit right in at 37signals. My work ethic, business philosophy, and appreciation for design align themselves well with what you guys are doing. I'm the type of person who can <strong>grow with a company.</strong></div></td>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Why Litmus has good support:</h2>
        I emailed Danielle, asking why email clients need to be selected to do spam testing.  She got back to me right away.  Her email was friendly, and  to the point.  She explained that &quot;for the moment all email clients need to be selected in order to run the tests.&quot;  Danielle apologized for how inefficient this was, and mentioned that they were currently looking for ways for users to choose individual tests.
        <p>What I liked most about the experience: I felt like I was <strong>talking to a human being</strong>. Her personality really came out in her response, which made it feel genuine and real.</p>
