		<h1>This is a web page.</h1>
		<p>There's not much here.</p>
		<p>Just words.</p>
		<p><strong>And you're reading them.</strong></p>
		<p>We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.</p>
		<p><strong>But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.</strong></p>
		<p>I wrote these words, and you're reading them: <em>that's</em> magical.</p>
		<p>I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else. I wrote this early in the morning, June 20th, 2013; you're probably reading it at a different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on your phone, a tablet or a desktop.</p>
		<p>You and I have been able to connect because<em> I wrote this </em>and <em>you're reading it.</em> <strong>That's the web</strong>. Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect <em>here, </em>on a simple HTML page.</p>
		<p>I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6&nbsp;kB. I didn't need a Content Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's not much code on this page at all, just simple markup for paragraphs, hierarchy, and emphasis.</p>
		<p>I remember teaching my daughter to code HTML when she was 8. The first thing she wrote was <a href="http://bizbox.ca/kidlet/">a story about a squirrel</a>. She wasn't &quot;writing HTML&quot;; <strong>she was sharing something with the world</strong>. She couldn't believe that she could write a story on our home computer, and then publish it for the world to see. She didn't really care about HTML, she cared about sharing her stories.</p>
		<p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>
		<p>Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show something you've made. <strong>And if your words are good, people will read them.</strong></p>
		<p>If you're a web designer, or a client who is working with one, I'd like to challenge you to think about words first. Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup, <em>start with words on a page</em>.</p>
		<p>What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding all that other cruft. <strong>Just start with one page</strong>, with a single focus. Write it and publish it, and then <em>iterate on that</em>. Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give my audience more understanding? If the answer's &quot;no&quot;, don't add it.</p>
		<p><strong>At its heart, web design should be about words</strong>. Words don't come <em>after</em> the design is done. Words are the beginning, the core, the focus.</p>
		<p>Start with words.</p>
		<p>
