                                          <!-- looks like these hidden inputs can be deleted, but thats sort of scary because it means the JS is pulling those data-attributes and stuff from the form tag.-
                                                The reason that's scary is because that means they are listening for clicks on the submit button,
                                                but the button has no real identifiers besides a class, which means im not sure what classes are
                                                safe to change and what ones are not

                                                the smart thing to do would be to download that JS file and reverse engineer the whole thing
                                                which sounds awful.

                                                Yeah. There's a lot of shit in there. What was wrong with the old system? ðŸ˜­
                                          
                                                i'm guessing its something to do with their new WYSWIG form builder, had to write something
                                                that was more flexible and therefore more complicated :/
