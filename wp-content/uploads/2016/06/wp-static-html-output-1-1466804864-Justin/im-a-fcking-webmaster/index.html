<h1>I'm a fucking webmaster</h1>
<p>Back in 1993 you weren't a designer, developer, copywriter or in devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your name was at the bottom of every page.</p>
<p>Let's talk about that. <strong>Your name was in the footer of every fucking page.</strong> The domain might have said <a href="http://tomstrucking.net">tomstrucking.net</a>, but it was built, hosted, and maintained by one person. If you had a question, you emailed <a href="mailto:webmaster@tomstrucking.net">webmaster@tomstrucking.net</a>.</p>
<p>And that address got a lot of email:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Can you put a hit counter on my web page?&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;I want my headline to be <span class="blink">blinking</span>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks treated webmasters like god damned magicians. Just email us with your cyberspace dreams, and we'll make them a reality.</p>
<p><em>We couldn't draw, but we harnessed simple design patterns and made them work.<br>
  We weren't engineers, but we could bend a CGI script to our will.<br>
  We weren't writers, but we discovered that words were the core of every page.</em></p>
<p>In the process of doing all these things, we fell in love.</p>
<p>What did we love? The <span class="third-degree">VARIETY</span>.</p>
<p>People would come to us with a <strong>problem</strong> and we would figure out a <strong>solution</strong>. We couldn't just search the web, <strong>because the web was still being written</strong>. And you couldn't just punt a hard question to the engineer in the desk next to you. Why? Because you were sitting alone in a utility closet packed with floppy disks and old tape drives.</p>
<p>This was the 90's, and webmasters came in all sorts of flavors. Some were IT people. Others came from the print world. Many worked in academia. There was a group that was more artsy fartsy (musicians, painters, writers). And there were <a href="http://nerdmullet.com/">snot-nosed kids</a> tying up their parents' landlines with dial-up modems.</p>
<p>Despite our diversity, we had a shared skill: <strong>we knew how to make a website.</strong> This, as it turns out, is pretty fucking fantastic.</p>
<p>Sure, you could charge someone and build them a website. But even better, <strong>you could make your own website.</strong> You'd publish whatever you were passionate about: <a href="https://www.spork.org/">sporks</a>, <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/">whisky</a>, or your hatred of <a href="http://toastytech.com/evil/index.html">Internet Explorer</a>. Crazy enough: you put that stuff online, and you'd meet other folks who liked the same damn thing. And all you really needed was a text editor (and maybe an FTP client). If webmasters were magicians, than the web was our magic.</p>
<p>Our websites were pretty damned ugly. Instead of worrying about window dressing, we focused on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">words</a>, hierarchy, and structure. Each new page started in a text editor looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;What's this fucking page about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what this fucking page is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information &lt;a href="#"&gt;go here, fucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Sure, it was simple, but it was focused. No distractions, just: what idea are you trying to express?</p>
<p>We've seen lots of cool shit built on the web, but we've also seen lots of bullshit too: barriers to entry, walled gardens, gatekeepers. Some things have been made unnecessarily complex. <strong>We need to remember that at its core a web page is simple.</strong> That's the beauty of it. And when you publish your own HTML to a server that you control; that's fucking powerful. Autonomy and independence are central to the web. We can't forget that.</p>
<p><strong>The world still needs some fucking webmasters.</strong> We might not all be making websites <em>professionally</em> anymore. But we should keep making websites. The passion, the freedom, the joy: we need to pass this on.</p>

<p> Let's take Tim's words and inspire a new generation to love a simple HTML page the same way we do.<strong></strong></p>
