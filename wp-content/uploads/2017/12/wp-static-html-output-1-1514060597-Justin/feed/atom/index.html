<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing the &#8220;December blues,&#8221; you&#8217;re not alone! The end of the year is demanding for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re reflective.</strong> You&#8217;re reviewing the good and the bad from 2017.</li>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re thinking about 2018. </strong>The new year is just weeks away, and you&#8217;re already making plans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus: <strong>December is busy</strong>. Personally, you&#8217;re shopping, and going to holiday events. Professionally, you&#8217;ve got tons of work to do!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder we&#8217;re overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>How to finish the year strong</h3>
<p><strong>You have about 8 work days left before Christmas day.</strong> That&#8217;s enough time for one last sprint before the new year.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a plan that&#8217;s worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose one project to finish.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to complete everything before 2018. Look at your project list, and pick one thing you can <em>reasonably </em>complete. Remember, 8 days isn&#8217;t a lot of time!</li>
<li><strong>Write a mini year-in-review</strong>. Take out a notepad, and write: &#8220;What are three things I&#8217;m thankful for this year?&#8221; In bullet form, list three things. Under that, ask yourself: &#8220;What are three things I&#8217;d like to improve next year?&#8221; Write out a few ideas for 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Do one thing to prepare for 2018.</strong> Now is a good time to connect with your coach, or your accountability group, and share your year-in-review. Let them suggest some practical steps you can take in January.</li>
</ol>
<p>This framework has helped me to be <strong>realistic </strong>about what I can finish. It also allows me to be <strong>reflective </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space">without being overwhelmed. And finally, it enables me to <strong>prepare </strong>for the new year</span>, with a list of things I can start doing on January 2nd.</p>
<p>The best part? <strong>It&#8217;s helped me to <em>enjoy </em>the holidays! </strong>Instead of feeling guilty about not getting enough work done, or being stressed about the new year, I can relax.</p>
<p><strong>You need to relax too!</strong></p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s take the next week to <em>work hard</em>, <em>reflect</em>, and <em>prepare</em>.</p>
<p>And after that&#8230; sit down with a hot drink and enjoy the warmth of the season.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />

Now my vision is much clearer. I&#8217;m ready for my next steps!<span class="redactor-invisible-space">&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>

<h3>Learn from Darian Rosebrook&#8217;s story</h3>

<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Darian is a designer living in Mt Vernon, Washington. He had the same challenges as me: a day job that took most of his time, and a new baby at home. But his dream was to build an audience and become an independent maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">So what did he do? <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">He started small</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">He looked on his hard drive, and found two design assets he&#8217;d used for other projects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buy.compassofdesign.com/topographic-vectors-and-images">Topographic map vectors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buy.compassofdesign.com/hi-resolution-dry-brushed-ink-textures">A collection of Photoshop ink brushes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He decided to put them up for sale on <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>, at $10 each.</p>
<p>To promote it, he posted it on <a href="https://compassofdesign.com/">his website</a>. He also told friends in a Slack group about it, and posted a few tweets.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">What happened?</strong></p>
<p>He earned his first dollars on the internet!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Getting those first sales was enough for me to believe that I can actually make something people are willing to pay money for. I was fairly unknown in the design space too, so it was surprising.&#8221; – <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Here&#8217;s what he learned:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised how many things you make in in client work that could be turned into a product. Even old pieces from other designs that are just lying around on my desktop or client folders.&#8221; – <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key is to <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">just get started</strong>. Doing <em data-redactor-tag="em">something</em> is better than sitting in your car and doing <em data-redactor-tag="em">nothing</em><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">. Now that Darian&#8217;s launched his first products, he&#8217;s closer to his goal of quitting his day job. It might take 2-3 more years of working at it, but that&#8217;s better than waiting forever!</span></p>
<h3>What should you do?</h3>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">1. Look through your hard drive</strong></p>
<p>You might already have assets that you could turn into a small product! Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">An Excel sheet that you use to calculate cash flow</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">A PDF checklist you use before you launch a new project</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Photographs that could be used as stock images</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Music you&#8217;ve composed that someone could use on their podcast</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Old sketches you made for a client, but they never used</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">2. Turn those assets into a sellable product</strong></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to take the item you&#8217;d like to sell and put some polish on it!</p>
<p>For Darian, this meant cleaning up his illustrations, and creating the .ai, .svg, .png, .jpg files.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">3. Get a digital storefront</strong></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">I recommend using <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>. They&#8217;ll give you a product page, host your files, and handle the checkout and delivery process.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Upload your files, upload a header image, and set a price!</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">4. Promote your product</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">To make sales, you&#8217;ll need to get the word out. Here are a few channels to try:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Online communities, Slack chats, Facebook Groups, and forums</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designernews.co/badges/show">&#8220;Show DN&#8221;</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/show">&#8220;Show HN&#8221;</a>, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a></li>
<li>Your mailing list or Twitter audience</li>
<li>Your friend&#8217;s mailing list, or Twitter audience</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get to this stage, please reply to this email and let me know! I&#8217;d love to help you get the word out.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/nba-justin-jackson/"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Justin Jackson. Let me tell you a story about how my life changed because of the NBA draft.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an athlete. I&#8217;m a geek. I’ve been working with SaaS companies since 2008. I was the Product Manager at Sprintly and Mailout.</p>
<p>Around 2012, I started a podcast called <a href="https://productpeople.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product People</a>. I interviewed people like Jason Fried, Hiten Shah, and Rob Walling. Folks loved it. At the same time, my writing on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justinjackson.ca</a> started to gain a lot of traction. People began signing up for <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my newsletter</a> too. They were coming to me for product &amp; marketing advice for their SaaS, software, mobile, and digital products. I offered <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulting calls</a>. That month I had 17 calls booked (that was too many).</p>
<p>When you googled &#8220;justin jackson&#8221; my site was the #1 result.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Are you Justin Jackson from the NBA?&#8221;</h3>
<p>And then, a talented 22-year-old basketball player was drafted by the Sacramento Kings. His name was also Justin Jackson.</p>
<p>I first noticed it when random kids started asking me questions on Snapchat.</p>

<p>I thought it was cute.</p>
<p>And then, I searched &#8220;justin jackson&#8221; on Google again.</p>
<p><strong>It was all NBA.</strong> Goodbye &#8220;nerdy guy from Canada,&#8221; hello &#8220;professional athlete.&#8221;</p>

<p>My search traffic plummeted. People started DMing to say they couldn&#8217;t find my site. When I went to speak at a conference, I had a few people tell me they&#8217;d googled me and didn&#8217;t attend my talk because &#8220;why would I want to hear from a basketball player at a tech conference?&#8221;</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing about it</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m pivoting everything over to the <a href="https://megamaker.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MegaMaker</a> brand.</p>
<p>All my <a href="https://megamaker.co/category/articles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best articles</a> on product marketing will live there.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my products</a> related to product marketing will live there.</p>
<p><em>(btw – <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/thanks/?convertkit=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Marketing Wins 3.0</a> is coming soon! <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/thanks/?convertkit=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to learn more.)</em></p>
<p>And, ultimately, MegaMaker will become something bigger than just me.</p>
<p>Already, I&#8217;ve hired Tim, Gary, and Andre to help me.</p>
<p>Together, we&#8217;re focused on one job:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We help digital product companies fix their product and improve their marketing, so that they can grow profits.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Is there a lesson here for you?</h3>
<p>On Twitter, folks have been asking me:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1703" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/nba-justin-jackson/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png?fit=580%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="580,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Question from Twitter: personal brand or company brand?" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png?fit=500%2C248&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png?fit=580%2C288&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1703" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png?resize=580%2C288&#038;ssl=1" alt="Question from Twitter: personal brand or company brand?" width="580" height="288" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png?resize=500%2C248&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason a lot of Hollywood stars change their names for the sake of their careers (Marilyn Monroe, Woody Allen). Your name is your brand. The Screen Actors Guild won&#8217;t let new actors join if they have the same name as another member (there can only be one Chuck Norris ?<span class="redactor-invisible-space">).</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>Pros to using your personal name:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re selling personal products and services (consulting, books) it makes sense to use your name. Ie. nathanbarry.com/books</li>
<li>Building a personal brand feels <em>personal</em>. People get connected to you as a person. They&#8217;ll seek out your conference talks, blog posts, videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons to using your personal name:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Would Nathan Barry have been able to use his name if it was Dave Barry? Not a chance. Dave Barry has been an author since 1983.</li>
<li>Personal names can&#8217;t be trademarked (unless it&#8217;s a unique brand you created).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>Company names have their own identity challenges.</strong> I&#8217;m an advisor for <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coach</a>, which often gets confused with Coach.me.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(Incidentally, MegaMaker has its own SEO problems. Search for &#8220;megamaker&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see someone else is using my name. Luckily, I registered the trademark in January 2017 and can fight it).</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">I used to wonder why founders got so upset when someone used a name similar to theirs. Now I know!</span></p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/contest/"><![CDATA[<p>One month ago, I went to New York City with my best friend.</p>
<p>It was an incredible trip. I made memories there that I&#8217;ll never forget.</p>
<p>I was also there to speak at Laracon 2017. (<a href="https://youtu.be/YaHXZT6RNs8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can see a clip here</a>)</p>
<p>At the conference, I met a guy named Yaz, who had built this cool app called ContestKit. People show me apps all the time, but I loved Yaz&#8217;s one sentence description:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way to create digital scratch and win tickets.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>His clients included a professional soccer team, who were using it to give out prizes during games.</p>
<p>He asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in running my own contest.</p>
<p>I knew I&#8217;d be releasing the new version of <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing for Developers</a> (my book) on August 31st.</p>
<p>I thought it&#8217;d be fun to do a bunch of giveaways before then. So today I&#8217;m introducing my first:</p>
<h3>Giveaway contest</h3>
<p><a href="https://megamaker.contestkit.com/c/marketing-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play now</a></p>
<p>Here are the prizes I&#8217;m giving away:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 x Full <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/marketing-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/marketing-for-developers&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1503639756797000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmoELO4iGjqvm6JH6F1-1VQuMrLQ">Marketing for Developers course</a> ($299)</li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><em><a href="https://megamaker.contestkit.com/c/marketing-for-developers">You can enter the contest here</a> (works great on mobile)</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get three chances to win (3 &#8220;scratch&#8221; tickets). After that, <a href="https://twitter.com/startupvernon/status/900592188173697024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can tweet</a> and get more chances.</p>
<p>Good luck! (I hope you win something!) The app is still new, so if you find bugs, <a href="https://contestkit.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let Yaz know</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Justin Jackson, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mijustin</a></p>
<p>PS: The new version of the Marketing for Developers is close! The new chapters are finished. <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up here for updates</a>. It&#8217;s getting released on August 31st.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/coffee/"><![CDATA[<p>As a solo-founder, I&#8217;m super busy. I do almost everything myself: product development, marketing, replying to emails, making podcasts, writing, and admin work.</p>
<p>If you email me asking me if I can jump on a call (or if you can pick my brain) chances are I&#8217;ll have to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry, I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m slammed right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Currently, <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">I&#8217;m working on this</a>).</p>
<p>However, I do have one exception: if you come to Vernon, BC, I&#8217;ll buy you a coffee.</p>
<p>I purposefully live in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, surrounded by lakes and mountains. It&#8217;s not easy getting here. So if you make the trip, and I&#8217;m around, I&#8217;ll happily meet you at Ratio Coffee downtown.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve had some people take me up on this offer. One fellow came from Japan. Two French Canadians were driving cross-country in a Westfalia. There was even Paul, from the UK, who rode his bicycle.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a programmer building software, or a SaaS (Software as a Service), this post should help you answer the question: &#8220;What would make someone buy my app?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the story of why I bought software from a guy named Peter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Note: if you like this post, <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">you&#8217;ll probably like my book</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Imagine the following scenes in my customer journey:</p>
<h2>Scene 1: &#8220;f*ck it, we&#8217;ll do it live!&#8221;</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve been developing a WordPress theme called Brutal. It&#8217;s a simple site design based on the brutalist aesthetic.</p>
<p>Initially, I made all my theme changes inside WordPress. It&#8217;s not a client project, so I wasn&#8217;t too worried about making changes on my live site. I&#8217;d just log in to WordPress admin, edit my theme, and click &#8220;update.&#8221;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1653" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/do-it-live/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?fit=1566%2C484&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1566,484" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Fuck it! We&#8217;ll do it live!" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?fit=500%2C155&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?fit=600%2C185&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1653" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?resize=600%2C185&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fuck it! We'll do it live!" width="600" height="185" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?w=1566&amp;ssl=1 1566w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?resize=500%2C155&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?resize=768%2C237&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?resize=1024%2C316&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Eventually, I started making mistakes. I&#8217;d change some code, screw something up, and have no way of reverting to a previous version.</p>
<p>I needed some version control. So I created a git repository and <a href="https://github.com/mijustin/brutal-theme">hosted it on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>My new process looked like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the theme files locally in Atom, my text editor.</li>
<li>Make my changes.</li>
<li>Push the changes up to GitHub.</li>
<li>Transfer my files to my web server via FTP.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Scene 2: the frustration</h2>
<p>As I worked with this new process, I kept muttering things under my breath:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Argh! There&#8217;s got to be a better way to do this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having to push my changes through git and FTP every time was frustrating. Sometimes I forgot to sync my changes to GitHub. I never knew where my latest version was.</p>
<p>Every time I went through that process, I got frustrated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;VE HAD ENOUGH! There&#8217;s got to be a plugin that does this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That day I added a card to my Trello board that said: &#8220;GitHub workflow for WordPress themes. (Plugin that exists).&#8221;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1650" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/github-wordpress-plugin/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?fit=2238%2C540&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2238,540" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="github-wordpress-plugin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?fit=500%2C121&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?fit=600%2C145&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1650" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?resize=600%2C145&#038;ssl=1" alt="GitHub WordPress Plugin on my Trello board" width="600" height="145" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?w=2238&amp;ssl=1 2238w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?resize=500%2C121&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?resize=768%2C185&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?resize=1024%2C247&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>Scene 3: the search for software</h2>
<p>I created that to-do on July 1st.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t until July 10th, at 4:31 pm that I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Damn it; it&#8217;s time to find a solution for this problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To start, I went to Google and typed in: &#8220;deploy WordPress theme changes with git.&#8221;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1651" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/google-search/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?fit=1598%2C266&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1598,266" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="google-search" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?fit=500%2C83&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?fit=600%2C100&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1651" src="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?resize=600%2C100&#038;ssl=1" alt="Google search deploy wordpress theme changes with git" width="600" height="100" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?w=1598&amp;ssl=1 1598w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?resize=500%2C83&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?resize=768%2C128&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?resize=1024%2C170&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A bunch of results came up; mostly blog posts.</p>
<p>I clicked on &#8220;<a href="http://culttt.com/2013/04/08/how-to-deploy-wordpress-themes-with-git/">How to deploy WordPress themes with Git</a>&#8221; first. It seemed too technical for me. I don&#8217;t use git from the command line (I use GitHub&#8217;s desktop app), and the workflow they described didn&#8217;t match up with mine. I clicked back to the search results.</p>
<p>The next result I found was for a SaaS called <a href="https://buddy.works/">Buddy</a>. It promised, &#8220;Continuous Delivery, simplified.&#8221; But again, it didn&#8217;t seem right for me. I was looking for something specifically built for WordPress. Furthermore, the screenshot showed a terminal-based workflow (which didn&#8217;t appeal to me). I went back to search.</p>
<p>I kept clicking and searching, but none of the search results promised a solution that was right for me.</p>
<p>My fifth click was on <a href="https://wppusher.com/">WP Pusher</a> made by a developer named <a href="https://twitter.com/petersuhm">Peter Suhm</a>.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, I knew I&#8217;d found my match.</p>
<h2>Scene 3: &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve found the solution!&#8221;</h2>
<p>Here is what appealed to me about WP Pusher:</p>
<ol>
<li>It had &#8220;WP&#8221; in the name, indicating that it was built specifically with WordPress in mind.</li>
<li>There were no screenshots of the terminal, signalling that this product wouldn&#8217;t be too technical for me.</li>
<li>The headline &#8220;From Git to WordPress&#8221; caught my attention, but it was the sub-header that grabbed me: &#8220;Deploy your plugins and themes directly from GitHub and never again copy files over FTP.&#8221;</li>
<li>The screenshot on the right showed what the plugin setup would look like in WordPress. I could instantly envision myself using it on my site.</li>
<li>There was a large &#8220;Download&#8221; button. This told me I&#8217;d be able to try the plugin right away, without having to pay first.</li>
</ol>
<p>This landing page is doing a bunch of things right.</p>

<p>First, the page immediately answers the questions: &#8220;Who is this for?&#8221; and &#8220;What are they struggling with?&#8221; It&#8217;s apparent that WP Pusher is for WordPress users trying to figure out their git workflow.</p>
<p>Next, he paints a vision of a better life: &#8220;Deploy your theme directly from GitHub and never again copy files over FTP.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>you can&#8217;t just talk about the pain the visitor is experiencing, you need to show them how you&#8217;re going to make their life better!</p>
<p>Finally, Peter gives potential users a quick way to download and try the plugin.</p>
<h2>Scene 4: &#8220;Let&#8217;s try this out&#8221;</h2>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to install the plugin and see if it works for me. I uploaded the plugin and got started.</p>
<p>A user&#8217;s first interaction with software will determine if they&#8217;re going to invest the time in using it.</p>
<p>I was asking questions like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does it feel well made?</li>
<li>Is this going to be easy to configure?</li>
<li>Does it work?</li>
</ol>
<p>After installing, WP Pusher shows you this welcome screen:</p>

<p>I skipped over the &#8220;License&#8221; tab and clicked on the GitHub tab. It asks you to generate a GitHub token, and auth with GitHub. Done.</p>
<p>After that, I chose the GitHub repository I wanted to use and connected it to the theme on my WordPress site.</p>
<p>Everything&#8217;s in place. Now it&#8217;s time for the moment of truth.</p>
<h2>Scene 5: the moment of truth</h2>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>I make some edits on <code>index.php</code>, and sync to GitHub.</p>
<p>Then I log into WordPress. Did it work? I can&#8217;t tell.</p>
<p>I go into the WP Pusher settings and see an &#8220;Update theme&#8221; button. I click it.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1655" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/update-theme/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?fit=1606%2C778&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1606,778" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Update theme button &#8211; WP Pusher" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?fit=500%2C242&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?fit=600%2C291&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1655" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?resize=600%2C291&#038;ssl=1" alt="Update theme button - WP Pusher" width="600" height="291" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?w=1606&amp;ssl=1 1606w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?resize=500%2C242&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>EUREKA.</p>
<p>It works. It pulls my changes from GitHub into WordPress.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s here I notice that &#8220;Push-to-Deploy&#8221; is disabled. After digging into the documentation, I figure out how to enable that.</p>
<p>Ok, let&#8217;s try it again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make an edit on my machine.</li>
<li>Push changes to GitHub.</li>
<li>Look at the template on my WordPress site.</li>
<li>HOLY SHIT IT UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s important for me to note that at <strong>this moment </strong>I feel like an absolute badass.</p>
<p>I want to share my discovery with the world! I write this tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">

<h2>Scene 6: Close the deal</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve just had my eureka moment. My life has been made better because of this plugin.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m ready to give Peter my money&#8230; but then I ran into a snag.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: there&#8217;s no compelling reason for me to upgrade. There&#8217;s a single line on the settings page that reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>You haven&#8217;t registered any license key for this installation. <a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING">Buy one here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to support Peter, so I click buy.</p>
<p>I see these options:</p>
<p><a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING"><img data-attachment-id="1656" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/buy/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?fit=2134%2C810&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2134,810" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Pricing grid for WordPress plugin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?fit=500%2C190&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?fit=600%2C228&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-1656 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?resize=600%2C228&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pricing grid for WordPress plugin" width="600" height="228" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?w=2134&amp;ssl=1 2134w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?resize=500%2C190&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?resize=1024%2C389&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Immediately, I have a few objections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do I even need to pay?</strong> I&#8217;m only using it on one site, with a public repository.</li>
<li><strong>None of these categories fit me</strong>. I&#8217;m not a freelancer, agency, or big agency. Is there no personal license?</li>
<li><strong>Why is this a yearly subscription? </strong>Does Peter have ongoing server costs? If I don&#8217;t want email support, can I just pay once? What reoccurring value do I get with the subscription?</li>
</ul>
<p>I almost clicked away, but I decide to click &#8220;Buy now.&#8221; Next, I see:</p>
<p><a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING"><img data-attachment-id="1657" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/software-saas-product-marketing/checkout-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?fit=1062%2C1120&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1062,1120" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="WordPress plugin checkout screen" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?fit=474%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?fit=600%2C633&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-1657 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?resize=600%2C633&#038;ssl=1" alt="WordPress plugin checkout screen" width="600" height="633" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?w=1062&amp;ssl=1 1062w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?resize=474%2C500&amp;ssl=1 474w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?resize=768%2C810&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png?resize=971%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 971w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I can now see that <strong>there is</strong> a personal license. At $39 it feels reasonable (although I&#8217;m still feeling a bit miffed about the subscription part). I can&#8217;t see what I get for that $39, but I&#8217;m assuming it means one site and the use of a private repository.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>My next objection: there&#8217;s no PayPal option!</p>
<p>I know PayPal is evil, and a pain in the ass. But for many of us, PayPal is where we keep our <strong>play money</strong>. It&#8217;s a guilt-free spending account.</p>
<p>Using my credit card feels like a bigger commitment. First, many of us outside of the US don&#8217;t have a USD credit card, so we have to pay high conversion rates. Second, the more recurring subscriptions I see on my credit card statement, the more anxiety I have. I don&#8217;t get the same stress from PayPal subscriptions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am 99.999% more likely to order from an online shop if they allow payment through PayPal.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> getting me to spend my PayPal money is easier than getting my credit card.</p>

<p><strong>But these payments don&#8217;t tell the whole story.</strong> You see only one event in a series of events. What are you missing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything that happened <em>before</em> the sale (what circumstances lead to the sale?)</li>
<li>Everything that happened <em>after </em>the sale (did the customer use the product? Were they satisfied? Did they tell anyone about it?)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understanding your customer&#8217;s journey is the key to unlocking more sales.</strong> Once you see the progress they&#8217;re trying to make you can optimize for every step: from initial discovery to purchase to satisfied customer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what your marketing strategy should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize discovery </strong>– you want to reach people who&#8217;ve had their &#8220;f*ck this, I&#8217;ve got to solve this&#8221; moment. For most software products, this is going to mean targeting the right search keywords on Google. (Meeting people where they&#8217;re at)</li>
<li><strong>Create a landing page that makes visitors say &#8220;Yes! This is for me!&#8221; </strong>– I discounted the first four search results because I didn&#8217;t feel like they understood my problem or my context. Have a clear understanding of who your product is for, and the struggle the face.</li>
<li><strong>Give users a quick win </strong>– I was sold on Peter&#8217;s plugin as soon as I pushed to GitHub and saw my theme update automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Give users a reason to pay you </strong>– Peter could ask users to pay once they pass a certain <em>usage threshold</em>. For example, users get five deploys free. After that, they need to buy a license. If I&#8217;m getting recurring value from a product, I&#8217;m highly incentivized to buy it.</li>
<li><strong>Make it easy for users to pay you </strong>– optimize your checkout process continuously. Figure out where users get stuck, and what objections they have. Reduce the friction!</li>
</ul>

<p>People want their lives to be better. They have a vision of where they want to go. But there are obstacles in their path. Customers hire products to help them move forward; to make progress towards their vision of a better life.</p>

<p>You can think of it this way: users &#8220;hire&#8221; software to help get their job done. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/alanklement">Alan Klement</a> defines it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customer + Product = Progress&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Products are like steroids. They should help users get stronger, faster.</p>
<p>Building successful products isn’t just about creating a ground-breaking technology! As Clayton Christensen explains in his book, Competing Against Luck:</p>
<blockquote><p>The word “progress” might not spring to mind when you’re trying to innovate. Instead you obsess about creating the perfect product with just the right combination of features and benefits to appeal to customers. You think you know just what your customers would like, but in reality, it can feel pretty hit or miss. Place enough bets and— with a bit of luck— something will work out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jobs to be Done helps you understand why a user might hire your software to get their job done.</p>
<h2>Who is using it?</h2>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done">Intercom</a> and <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/radio/jason-fried-on-jobs-to-be-done-radio/">Basecamp</a> have made big bets on JTBD and made it a part of their product development process.</p>
<p>Jason Fried, of Basecamp, <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-why-before-the-why-c5492520acf0">reported</a> that interviewing their customers generated valuable product insights:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s most interesting is the situations people find themselves in before they’re our customers. It’s not about this industry or that one. It’s not about demographics, either. It’s not even about the competitive set, yet. It’s all about the situation they’re in, the reality they’re trying to wrangle, and the progress they’re trying to make.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Describing a job to be done</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of how Freshbooks might define their JTBD:</p>
<blockquote><p>Free me from the agony of creating and tracking invoices manually so that I can get paid faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alan Klement has <a href="https://overcast.fm/+HXQywwU_M">three criteria for defining a JTBD</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you’re not describing a task or activity. It&#8217;s not about getting a drill so you can drill a 3/4&#8243; hole. It’s about how your life gets better after you use the drill: hanging a beautiful painting and having your friends admire it.</li>
<li>Describe how the customer has solved that job in the past, and how they might solve it in the future.</li>
<li>Understand what motivates the customer. How will things be better for the user when they overcome the struggle?</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you figure out the JTBD for your product? You’ll need to get a deeper understanding of the customer’s journey and their motivation for change.</p>
<h1>Seeing the customer journey</h1>
<p>Understanding the initial trigger, and the events that lead up to the purchase will help you design an effective marketing strategy for your product.</p>
<p>You can visualize the process like this:</p>

<h2>Customer interviews</h2>
<p>One way to understand someone&#8217;s Job to be Done is to interview them.</p>
<p>Alan Klement has written an excellent guide on conducting interviews, with sample questions you can ask.</p>
<p>He recommends starting with these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>When did you purchase the product?</li>
<li>Where were you?</li>
<li>What time of day was it? (daytime/ nighttime?)</li>
<li>What was the weather like?</li>
<li>Was anyone else with you at the time?</li>
<li>How did you purchase the product?</li>
<li>Did you buy anything at the same time?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don&#8217;t yet have a product, you can ask a competitor&#8217;s customers these questions.</p>
<p>The interviewee&#8217;s answers will help you understand the context of the actual buying decision.</p>
<p>(To learn how to do JTBD interviews the right way, I highly recommend <a href="http://learn.jobstobedone.org/">this course</a> by Chris Spiek, Bob Moesta &amp; Ervin Fowlkes.)</p>
<h2>Observation</h2>
<p>Aside from interviews, you can also observe people making purchasing decisions, both in-person and online.</p>
<p>Folks often leave clues on social media, in forums, and in blog posts, that help us understand the timeline behind a purchase.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example from Twitter user @dakotaw:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">i&#39;ve bought almost one self-help book per day for the last week</p>
<p>lord bless it</p>
<p>&mdash; dakota williams (@dakotaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/dakotaw/status/883057964319461376">July 6, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He mentions he is buying a new book almost every day. Five days later he tweets this message:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">seriously thinking about getting a kindle + kindle unlimited. do any of y&#39;all have experience / thoughts on it? cc <a href="https://twitter.com/zmagg">@zmagg</a></p>
<p>&mdash; dakota williams (@dakotaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/dakotaw/status/884803205661687808">July 11, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In this case, buying a lot of books serves as a trigger to consider the Kindle Unlimited service.</p>
<p>How would we define Dakota&#8217;s JTBD?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Give me unlimited digital books so that I can read more self-help books.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What else could Dakota hire to get this job done? Kindle Unlimited isn&#8217;t his only option. He could also hire:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public library</li>
<li>Audible audio books</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindle Unlimited also competes with anything else that might attract Dakota&#8217;s attention: Netflix, podcasts, and college courses.</p>
<h2>Optimize for the job to be done</h2>
<p>In 10+ years of doing product marketing, I haven’t found a better framework for understanding why people buy software.</p>
<p>JTBD shows us that we’re not in the business of making products, we&#8217;re trying to make super humans. In the words of Kathy Sierra, the purpose of a product is to make a “badass user:” your app should give users abilities they never had before.</p>
<p>You can use JTBD principles to observe human beings and gain two valuable insights:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do they want their life to be better?</li>
<li>What obstacles stand in their way?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you understand this, you build products that help people improve their lives. You’re not guessing; you’re delivering the progress they desire.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that you organize all of your efforts around helping users make progress. Whether it’s marketing, coding, or customer support, everything should contribute to their forward movement.</p>
<p>JTBD is particularly useful when you’re deciding which features to build. Think about what John Palmer is saying here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jobs to be Done does not describe what the product must do; it describes what the customer must do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A new feature should give your user the ability to do something they weren’t able to do before.</p>
<p>For example, I use Canva.com to design book covers, podcast art, and header graphics for blog posts. Previously, I had to hire a designer to do those things. It was costly and slowed me down.</p>
<p>But now, with Canva, I have a new superpower: I can design assets myself. We might describe the JTBD like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>    “Give me the ability to do design work myself, so that I can publish my work sooner (without waiting for a designer.”</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="d0ad" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Here’s my response:</h3>

<p id="d36a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Identifying a “need” isn’t enough:</p>

<h3>Non-software examples</h3>
<p><i>LA Weight Loss</i> markets it’s program by promising customers something they <b>want</b>: a sexier body.</p>
<p><img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e93e5022ca41802f4bbc119e8664034" /></p>
<p>Elon Musk got more people driving electric cars by starting with something people <b>wanted</b>: a fast, luxurious vehicle. (The Model S can go from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds).</p>
<p><img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-95e07dd954584f01a0d2bcb26ebb0f51" /></p>
<h3>James&#8217; theory</h3>
<p>My friend <a href="https://jamesclear.com">James Clear</a> has a theory: many positive habits (like a healthy diet) are painful in the short term, but rewarding in the long-term.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult for people to do things they know are good for them. The benefit is too far in the future. Eating candy has an immediate reward (it tastes good), but a long term detriment (weight gain, disease). Eating vegetables is the opposite: short term pain, but a healthier future.</p>
<p>James believes that the secret to motivating people is to align the long-term benefit with a short term reward.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re going to sell an environmentally friendly vehicle, start by marketing it as a luxury sports car. Early in Tesla&#8217;s history, people <strong>wanted </strong>the status of owning the exclusive roadster. To help the world reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Elon Musk had to create a product that gave people a short-term reward (in this case, status and speed).</p>
<h3>How does this apply to building a software product?</h3>
<p>My favorite example is <a href="https://www.datingring.com/">Dating Ring</a>.</p>

<p>They launched with a bold premise: a dating site without profile photos. It&#8217;s a rational idea. If you&#8217;re looking for a lifelong partner, swiping left or right on a photo is too superficial. Through experimentation, they discovered that a blind date with a group of people was the best way to find a potential mate.</p>
<p>Single people needed their service, but it wasn&#8217;t what they wanted.</p>
<p>Signups suffered because users wanted to see photos of possible matches. Dating Ring was forced to relaunch with a site that allowed people to upload photos, and control their preferences.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Recognize that <em>people might not want the progress our product provides</em>.</p>
<p>Customers don&#8217;t make purchasing decisions rationally. They buy emotionally and then rationalize their purchase with logic.</p>

<p>Too many smart people are trying to sell products that people <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">need</strong>, instead of building something people <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">want.</strong></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/membership-website/"><![CDATA[<p>Have you built an audience through your podcast, blog, or YouTube channel? Creating a membership website is a great way to start earning an independent income.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve had three podcasts (<a href="http://megamaker.co/">MegaMaker</a>, Build &amp; Launch, and <a href="http://productpeople.tv/">Product People</a>) all focused on a very specific niche. They&#8217;re for software developers, designers, and other makers who want to launch their own digital products (apps, software, courses).</p>
<p>Here are things I tried that <strong>didn&#8217;t work: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advertising. </strong>Attracting good advertisers is really difficult. In podcasting, there&#8217;s only a handful of companies that sponsor (Casper, MailChimp, Squarespace, Freshbooks), and their minimum requirements for downloads keeps increasing.</li>
<li><strong>Crowdfunding.</strong> I ran my own campaign using a WordPress plugin called <a href="http://ignitiondeck.com/id/">Ignition Deck</a>. The idea was that listeners could support future topics by sponsoring their favorite idea. I wouldn&#8217;t do this one again. Most of the support came from a single advertiser who would have supported regardless.</li>
<li><strong>Micro-sponsorships.</strong> The idea here was to allow people to sponsor for as little as $99<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="4 clicks">4</span>. You really have to be aggressive to get <strong>any</strong> ad money. But, there are listeners who want to promote their projects, and would be willing to spend $99 to $199. I might try this approach again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I tried that <strong>did work: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Membership site. </strong>It&#8217;s not easy to run an online community, but so far the benefits have outweighed the challenges. <a href="http://productpeople.club/">Here&#8217;s my membership site</a>. The most challenging part was finding the right platform. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to talk about below!</li>
<li><strong>Physical products. </strong>T-shirts, stickers, etc&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Digital products. </strong>Ebooks, online courses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How much revenue can you earn from a membership website?</h2>
<p>I initially launched <a href="https://productpeople.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://productpeople.club/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHG2ISrnjjsVK-kNowNs9a0e3QpGQ">Product People Club</a> as a side-project. Since then, it&#8217;s earned nearly $76,000. This is way more revenue than advertising or anything else I&#8217;ve tried:</p>
<div class="m_8935617447031594971gmail-lightbox-wrapper">

The biggest benefit is I don&#8217;t have to chase advertisers, or try to pump up my download numbers for my podcast.</p>
<p>I can make the show my fans wants, and give them an opportunity to dive even deeper to the subject matter in the private forums.</p>
<p>I highly recommend selling annual subscriptions instead of monthly. (I actually just switched to pay once for lifetime access)</p>
<h2>Which community platform should you choose?</h2>
<p>Last year I tried Mightybell and it was a disaster.I had high hopes for it, especially because it had chat + mobile app built-in. But it was plagued by bugs, and had a really bad UI. It may have improved since then, but our members really didn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>For context, here are the platforms I&#8217;ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campfire</li>
<li>BuddyPress (turns WordPress into social network)</li>
<li>bbPress (WordPress forums)</li>
<li>P2 (another WordPress update driven platform)</li>
<li>Mightybell</li>
<li><strong>Now: </strong>Discourse + Memberful</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to set up an online membership site</h2>
<p>Here is the setup I use for my community, the <a href="https://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://memberful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://memberful.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEPDzucpDP5wipwiPbHvJKQfVihg"><span class="il">Memberful</span></a> is the main platform (billing, registration, renewals, etc&#8230;)</li>
<li><span class="il">Memberful</span> automatically connects to <a href="http://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.discourse.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiZ-0nufv1pgcP0ACesKqafuD32w"><span class="il">Discourse</span></a> forums, which I host on <a href="https://m.do.co/c/d12c8c2c375a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://m.do.co/c/d12c8c2c375a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkdikOiUjbTYA_R9T7h282FxCS7g">Digital Ocean</a>.</li>
<li><span class="il">Memberful</span> automatically adds members to my <a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://mailchimp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKKChpniXxuRZGZUx27xE0NqHX8Q">MailChimp</a> mailing list. I use this to send members a welcome email with a free download + a weekly newsletter.</li>
<li><span class="il">Memberful</span> also allows you offer exclusive digital downloads for your members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Memberful basically got my business back because of Discourse. They make it easy to accept payment + integrated with Discourse and MailChimp.</p>
<p>Once a new member signs up, they get this is the automated sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=8cb83b3f841a6035fab28a85e&amp;id=ac0a0181a0&amp;e=0753f272b1">Day 1: Welcome!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=8cb83b3f841a6035fab28a85e&amp;id=c182278d58&amp;e=451ade37d7">Day 2: Community basics</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>How to launch a membership website</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s very difficult to create an online community if you haven&#8217;t first built up an audience.</p>
<p>My recommendation: create a landing page (<a href="https://productpeople.club">like this</a>) and create a waiting list. 1,000 email addresses is a good benchmark for when to launch. Only open up 10 spots at a time, so you can personally onboard new members and get the discussion going.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/standstill/"><![CDATA[<p>What happens in Vegas is supposed to stay in Vegas, but I&#8217;m going to tell you about a crazy experience I had.</p>
<p><em>(Note: this is the third issue of my <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/indie/">newsletter for independent makers</a>. Subscribe <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/indie/">here</a>.)</em></p>
<p>I was recently in town speaking at a conference.</p>
<p>The first night, there was a party for attendees. I got talking to the bartender. He was an older gentleman in his 70s. He told me some history about the Tropicana hotel: how it had opened in 1957 and had links to the famous mobster, Frank Costello.</p>
<p>I asked him how long he&#8217;d been there. He responded: &#8220;1966.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Whoa.</h3>
<p>He joked that he&#8217;d be standing in the same place for 50 years. In those years, he&#8217;d seen the Vegas strip transform around him. The Tropicana was initially one of the only hotels on the strip.</p>

<p>Since then, nearly 40 hotels have been added to the area.</p>

<p>This bartender&#8217;s 50+ years of service was impressive.</p>
<p>However, his life hasn&#8217;t changed much in those years. He&#8217;s still doing the same job: serving drinks to conference goers and revelers.</p>
<p>And maybe, he has no regrets. But this image struck me: his life had stayed the same while everything else had changed around him.</p>
<h3>There&#8217;s a danger in standing still.</h3>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">When you don&#8217;t move, the world grows up around you.</em></p>
<p>Instead of being a creative force on your surroundings, you become a passive observer. Onlookers can say &#8220;I was there,&#8221; but miss out on the satisfaction of making stuff happen.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Human history has always rewarded individuals in motion.</strong> Successful people don&#8217;t stand around waiting for things to happen. Instead of being passive observers, they focus on moving forward.</p>
<p>Our natural tendency is to play it safe: &#8220;don&#8217;t rock the boat, don&#8217;t make mistakes.&#8221; But mistakes are how we make progress.</p>
<p>The healthiest people I know are grateful for the present but aren&#8217;t satisfied to stay put. They want to get better, create new things, and follow their curiosity.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to wake up in 50 years and realize that I just stayed put. I want to make my life better.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
<h3>A better future</h3>
<p>Traditionally, I haven&#8217;t been a fan of &#8220;magical thinking.&#8221; Currently, there is an NBA draft with the same name as me. I&#8217;m a 5&#8217;8&#8243; nerdy Canadian. No matter how hard I work, I&#8217;ll never be a pro basketball player.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/convertkit.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pictures/166/530096/content_nba.jpg?w=600&#038;ssl=1" alt="&quot;I'm not the ? player. I'm just a nerd from ??&quot;" data-verified="redactor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">To move forward, you have to have an imagination for the future. You need to envision a better life: what does it look like?</span></p>
<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve held myself back with the belief that my life will always be the same as it is now. I&#8217;d tell myself: &#8220;I&#8217;ll never achieve that success. That dream isn&#8217;t for people like me.&#8221; I&#8217;d limit my imagination. I call this being &#8220;haggard.&#8221; It&#8217;s stewing in life&#8217;s difficulty, instead of seeing its possibility.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t limit your potential! Be open to the idea of progress. If you&#8217;re closed, you won&#8217;t move forward. Develop a dogged determination to make life better every day.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
