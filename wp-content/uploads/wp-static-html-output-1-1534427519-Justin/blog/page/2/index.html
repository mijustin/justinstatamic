			<h2>
  What would you do differently?</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>Adam Clark recently asked me this question <a href="https://thegentlymad.com/podcasts/tgm067-justin-jackson/">on his podcast:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>If you woke up tomorrow, and you had to start all over again, what would you do?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a good question. If I didn&#8217;t have <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a> or my existing audience, how would I build a business knowing what I know now? What would I change?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I said:</p>
<h3>First, get a therapist</h3>
<p>I struggled with depression this past year. I&#8217;ve seen firsthand how mental health affects every part of your life, including your business!</p>
<p>My first step as a new entrepreneur would be to build rapport with a therapist.</p>
<p>Talking with a professional counselor on a regular basis has been incredibly valuable for me. On the one hand, it&#8217;s a safe place for me to get my feelings out. On the other, my therapist has helped me avoid knee-jerk reactions, and carefully consider my next steps.</p>
<p>I avoided my mental health for years and inadvertently buried many issues I should have dealt with a long time ago. <strong>It&#8217;s worth investing in your mental health now!</strong></p>
<p>Someone on Twitter asked me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok, but how did you find your therapist?</p></blockquote>
<p>If I remember correctly, I started by googling:</p>
<p><code>[my hometown] therapist</code></p>
<p>I looked at dozens of websites.  I emailed three therapists and ended up booking an initial session with two. The idea was to get to know them, describe what was going on with me, and see who would be a good fit.</p>
<p>My session with one of the counselors went really well; I felt I could trust her. After that, I booked a regular one-hour appointment. Now, I see her at least once a month.</p>
<p>Your mental health is the foundation you&#8217;ll build your business on; so take care of it first!</p>
<h3>Second, I wouldn&#8217;t target beginners</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that beginners often don&#8217;t make good customers. (Especially in B2B markets)</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most free resources and tools target beginners.</li>
<li>Novices don&#8217;t have the same capacity to pay as experts do.</li>
<li>Most new startups fail, so they don&#8217;t make stable, long-term customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a better plan: help an intermediate go pro.</strong></p>
<p>Intermediates have proven they can survive the startup stage. However, now they&#8217;ve exhausted all of the free resources, and they&#8217;re starting to plateau. They&#8217;re motivated to get to the next level and are looking for outside help.</p>
<p>My friend Marcus was a freelance videographer. He saw that his peers knew a lot about camera gear and filming technique, but had a hard time closing sales. They were making some money, but he knew they could unlock more revenue by applying a handful of tactics.</p>
<p>So he started offering mentoring and workshops to teach business skills to video professionals.</p>
<h3>Third, I would get a job</h3>
<p>You can be so much more helpful if you&#8217;ve already been in the trenches. There&#8217;s no replacement for experiencing a struggle first-hand.</p>
<p>I opened a snowboard shop in my early 20s. I&#8217;d never worked in retail before, and that was a huge mistake. If I could have seen the other side of owning a retail store (the endless paperwork, ordering nightmares, handling inventory, managing employees), I would probably have never started it.</p>
<p>If I were going to start again, in a new industry, I would get a job or start consulting. As I worked, I would observe, and take notes about the daily struggles people face.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll build a better business if you&#8217;ve felt the pain yourself!</p>
<h3>Fourth, I would meet people</h3>
<p>Your real unfair advantage in business is your network.</p>

<p>Education, wealth, and skills all help, but it&#8217;s &#8220;who you know&#8221; that makes the difference.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs. In almost every single case, their success didn&#8217;t come from some magical ability or secret life hack. Nope. The big jumps forward came when someone encouraged them to do something, taught them a new skill, or gave them an opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Hiten Shah who told me to start taking <a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/75552">ConvertKit</a> seriously, or shut it down, &#8221; says Nathan Barry, &#8220;so I decided to double down. I hired a developer, invested $50k, and shut down my other business.&#8221;</p>
<p>That paid off pretty good for Nathan (ConvertKit is currently doing over $1 million per month in revenue)</p>
<p>So if I had to start again, I would focus heavily on building my network.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d force myself to get out of the house. I&#8217;d go to meetups and conferences.  I would fly to different cities for a week at a time and connect with interesting people. I would start an interview podcast.</p>
<p>Relationships are worth investing in; they pay big dividends.</p>

<h2>
  When you&#8217;re building a product, whose opinion should you listen to?</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to make things that people want.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">A band might record an album hoping their fans will love it.</strong> But when they release it, it doesn&#8217;t sell.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">A software company releases a new feature thinking it will hockey-stick their growth.</strong> But when they deploy it, users complain.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">A blogger pours hours of research into a single post</strong>. But when he hits publish, he doesn&#8217;t get any traffic.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be out of touch with their audience. But it happens all the time. Even big companies make these mistakes.</p>
<h3>A story about unmet expectations</h3>
<p>In 2016, developers, video editors, and other pro users were eagerly awaiting Apple&#8217;s refresh of the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>However, when they got their hands on it, it was clear Apple had missed the mark.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Apple</a> Utterly dissapointed with the new macbook pro. The computer is way too expensive. New model removes USB, SD Card slot, magsafe. ????</p>
<p>— Ivy (@Ivan_Krazy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ivan_Krazy/status/795197765420650496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In all my years of using Apple products, I have never returned one. Until now. Last month I purchased the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. What a letdown. It&#8217;s the first Apple device that&#8217;s actually made me less productive. The company has lost touch with Steve Jobs&#8217; vision for simple, elegant machines.<span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">&#8221; – <a href="https://michaelhyatt.com/new-macbook-pro/">Michael Hyatt</a></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why did Apple lose touch with their customers?</h3>
<p>I think they just weren&#8217;t listening.</p>
<p>Leading up to the 2016 MacBook Pro reveal event, Sascha Segan, writing for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/348897/10-things-we-want-from-the-new-apple-macbook-pro">PC Magazine</a>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>To me, the most important aspect of the MacBook Pro is the &#8220;pro&#8221; part. This laptop should be a no-compromise workhorse for getting your business done on the road. I&#8217;ve been reading the rumors of what may be coming and going with some trepidation. Like many pro-level MacBook users, my biggest concern isn&#8217;t about what Apple is adding—it&#8217;s what might be taken away. I chose a Pro because it gives me the power, the ports, and the keyboard to get all of my work done.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Of course, there are many differing perspectives on Apple&#8217;s products.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">How could they know which voices to listen to, and which to ignore?</span></p>
<h3>People are complicated</h3>
<p>When you put anything out into the world, people will have opinions about it. And, to make things more confusing, everybody wants something different.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Why? People value different things depending on their context.</strong></p>
<p>With laptops, different groups want different features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Students </strong>want a laptop that is affordable, and lightweight (because they&#8217;ll be lugging it to class).</li>
<li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Programmers </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">want a laptop with a high-resolution screen, lots of memory, and a full-size keyboard.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Gamers </strong>want a CPU and GPU with a lot of horsepower. They also don&#8217;t mind as much if the laptop is bulky.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Even these examples are too general because a person&#8217;s context has multiple dimensions. Some college students are wealthy. Many programmers are assigned computers by their employers and don&#8217;t have a say in what they get. Most gamers prefer a desktop machine because it&#8217;s easier to upgrade individual components.</p>
<p>So, you could ask a programmer &#8220;what&#8217;s your dream laptop?&#8221; and they might give you a truthful answer. But, if their boss is buying the computer, it might not matter what the programmer thinks. Unless the boss is a good boss, in which case the programmer&#8217;s opinion matters quite a bit.</p>
<p>Do you see how this can get complicated?</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Who you listen to </strong>matters quite a bit.</p>
<h3>Who you should listen to (and how you should listen)</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to give some very general advice, and some of you might disagree when you hear it:</p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">When it comes to product feedback, only listen to the people paying for your product. Explore <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">their</strong></em><em data-redactor-tag="em"> context; find out what&#8217;s important to <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">them</strong>.</em></p>
<p>I know some of you are screaming: &#8220;BUT SOME USERS DON&#8217;T PAY FOR THE PRODUCT AND THEIR VOICES ARE STILL IMPORTANT.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you. I too want to build products that benefit the actual users.</p>
<p>But, look at Facebook and Google. Many of us use them every day, but we don&#8217;t pay for them. Advertisers do. Facebook and Google don&#8217;t seem to care much about our privacy. They&#8217;ll track us, and share our information without our consent. Why? Their allegiance is with advertisers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a business serves whoever is paying them.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our laptop example.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky is the founder of Fogcreek Software and has probably bought hundreds of laptops. If you were trying to sell him your computers, you&#8217;d want to read <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">his blog</a> and figure out what he values. In his case, he cares about treating developers well. He wants to give them autonomy. He&#8217;ll let them choose their machine and the tools they use.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ready to put this principle into action? Here are the steps I recommend:</p>
<h3>1. Serve a customer you care about</h3>
<p>You need founder/market fit with the people you&#8217;re serving; product/market fit isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t sell laptops to CTOs who don&#8217;t care about their developers! If you don&#8217;t respect the person paying you for your service,</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving a damn&#8221; about your customers is a substantial competitive advantage.</p>
<h3>2. Only take product feedback from people paying for your product</h3>
<p>The opinion of random people on Twitter&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t matter. Likewise, don&#8217;t listen to folks who keep saying they&#8217;ll buy your product, but never do. Their opinion doesn&#8217;t matter either.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Famously, Jason Fried said he only listens to feedback from customers who just bought or people who just canceled.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://danshipper.com/heres-what-i-learned-hanging-out-with-jason-fried">Dan Shipper</a> elaborates:</p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">A customer who just signed up can give good feedback for this reason: they&#8217;re only recently removed from the buying process. Because of this, it&#8217;s easier to get useful information about why they bought your product, what emotional event caused them to look for it and which part of it is actually useful for them.</em></p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">Similarly, a customer who just canceled can tell you exactly what you&#8217;re missing. They signed up and put their credit card information in because they thought you would be able to do a job for them. If they cancel, your product didn&#8217;t deliver what they expected.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t build features for people who aren&#8217;t paying you! Don&#8217;t try to please folks who haven&#8217;t proven that they&#8217;re willing to be your customer.</p>
<p>Are you a brand new startup with no customers? Jason advises that you talk to people who are paying for your <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">competitor&#8217;s</strong> product.</p>
<h3>3. Explore your customer&#8217;s context</h3>
<p>Get close to the customer, and observe how they&#8217;re using your product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those people who didn&#8217;t upgrade to the new MacBook Pros. Why? Here&#8217;s what my computer looks like most days:</p>

<p>If Apple had paid attention to how I, and many other pro customers, use their laptops every day, maybe they would have thought differently about what they offered in the new MacBook Pros.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recently sold my 2017 13&quot; MBP (for a profit), and went back to my 2013 13&quot; MBP. Keyboard was too shallow, TouchBar was pretty useless, and no noticeable boost in performance. It was a beautiful machine though.</p>
<p>It feels great to have a &quot;normal&quot; keyboard and USB 3 ports again!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>4. Listen to your customers</h3>
<p>Beyond observing your customers, you should also do customer interviews. Ask customers questions: What are they struggling with? In what ways do they want their lives to be better?</p>
<p>Going back to the MacBook Pro example, we saw many Apple customers stating: &#8220;This is what I wanted, and I&#8217;m disappointed by what I got.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users wanted more memory, more power, and a full-size keyboard (&#8220;Don&#8217;t take away my ESC key!&#8221;). Many folks wanted that SD card slot and more ports. But what they got was a thinner, lighter machine with a touch bar. That&#8217;s why there was so much disappointment.</p>
<p>The new offering didn&#8217;t feel like a step forward. It felt like a step back.</p>
<p>For years, Apple produced a MacBook Pro that users loved. But, in this case, they got it wrong.</p>
<p>Their example shows how difficult product/market fit is.</p>
<p>As entrepreneurs, we need to listen to our customers. What do they care about now? What do they want now?</p>
<p>Customers are a moving target; their context and desires are continually evolving. Our job is to listen.</p>

<h2>
  Why I&#8217;m building a new SaaS in 2018</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>Back in the Spring of 2015, I was chatting with Nathan Barry.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d recently decided to leave his info-product business behind, and double-down on his SaaS (ConvertKit).</p>
<p>At the time, the decision seemed ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>I was working as a Product Manager for Sprintly but had just published <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>. I was eagerly anticipating a time where I&#8217;d be able to quit my job and go independent.</p>
<p>To me, Nathan was living the dream. The year previously he&#8217;d done nearly $300,000 in revenue from books and courses.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1783" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/new-saas/nathan-barry-net-income/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?fit=540%2C358&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="540,358" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Nathan Barry net income" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?fit=500%2C331&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?fit=540%2C358&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1783" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?resize=540%2C358&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nathan Barry net income" width="540" height="358" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?resize=500%2C331&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As someone who was looking on longingly from the sidelines, I couldn&#8217;t imagine leaving that kind of business behind.</p>
<p>When I asked him about it, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a bunch of reasons I decided to focus on ConvertKit. First, I needed a challenge. Second, <strong>I know people that have gotten to half a million or a couple million dollars a year in revenue off books and courses. And when I look at their business models, I just don’t like it.</strong> To get to $1 million in revenue you have to optimize just about everything. It’s diminishing returns; it’s like squeezing blood from a stone. To drive more revenue, you have to do more launches, and hire more people. Folks that are winning at info-products have huge monthly expenses and lower profit margins. With SaaS, I saw a substantial business I could grow for a long time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I shook my head. It still seemed crazy to me. In 2014, ConvertKit had done about $39,000 in revenue (almost 8x less than his books). I just didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<h3>Fast forward two years</h3>
<p>I followed Nathan&#8217;s playbook, and went independent in 2016, using <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a> and <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> as my platform. In 2017 I added <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> to my product mix.</p>
<p>Revenue-wise, my little solo business did pretty well:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1784" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/new-saas/justin-net-income-books-courses/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/justin-net-income-books-courses.png?fit=700%2C371&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="700,371" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Justin Jackson product revenue" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/justin-net-income-books-courses.png?fit=500%2C265&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/justin-net-income-books-courses.png?fit=600%2C318&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1784" src="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/justin-net-income-books-courses.png?resize=600%2C318&#038;ssl=1" alt="Justin Jackson product revenue" width="600" height="318" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/justin-net-income-books-courses.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/03/justin-net-income-books-courses.png?resize=500%2C265&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>But something else happened in my second year of business. Something I didn&#8217;t expect. I got depressed. For the first time in my life, I was dealing with intense mental health issues. There were weeks where I was only able to work five hours total.</p>
<p>There was a huge downside to solopreneurship that I hadn&#8217;t considered: when you get sick, there&#8217;s nobody else around to keep your business running. Most of my marketing, video tutorials, and coaching require me to be charismatic and energetic; there were many days where I just couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>When the year ended, I was mentally and financially drained.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to therapy, I&#8217;m feeling a lot better now. But the experience moved me.</p>
<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>The past two years have taught me some valuable lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&#8217;ve worked too hard, and haven&#8217;t left enough margin in my life.</strong> Brennan Dunn warned me about this in a private conversation at MicroConf. I&#8217;ve been doing too much of the work myself, and haven&#8217;t leveraged automation when I should have.</li>
<li><strong>The info-products business is hard to scale.</strong> Doing courses, workshops, and books have helped me earn an independent income. I plan to continue doing it while we&#8217;re building this new SaaS. But, like Nathan mentioned, scaling it is difficult. You&#8217;re either on a never-ending hamster wheel of launches, or, you&#8217;re investing in employees, sophisticated automation, and non-stop webinars.</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m ready to partner up. </strong>I&#8217;ve always liked working alone. But my health scare this past year changed me. The advantage of having a partner, is you&#8217;ve got someone to lean on when times get tough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The announcement: I&#8217;m building a new podcasting SaaS</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a>. It was started by my friend Jon Buda, in Chicago. I&#8217;m coming on as his co-founder.</p>
<p>Jon and I were introduced in 2014 by our mutual friend Chase Reeves at XOXO in Portland. Here&#8217;s a photo from the day we met:</p>

<p>At the time, I was writing Marketing for Devs. Jon was working on a podcasting app with someone else. He invited me to host my podcast with him.</p>
<p>Before we left, we said: &#8220;Let&#8217;s build something together someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jon&#8217;s first partnership didn&#8217;t work out. He eventually got a job doing full-stack web dev in Chicago. We kept in touch and met up again in 2015.</p>
<p>In June 2016, we tried building a community platform. Ultimately, we decided not to move forward with the idea, but it gave us a chance to work together.</p>
<p>Finally, in December 2017, Jon told me about a new podcasting project he&#8217;d started: <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor</a>. He was getting tired of working on it by himself. I was tired of working solo too. So we started talking about partnering up.</p>
<p>We finished signing all the legal documents last week. We&#8217;re now official co-founders!</p>
<h3>What is Transistor.fm? How does it compare to other podcasting hosting apps?</h3>
<p>Businesses like Basecamp, eBay, and Code Pen have discovered the power of having a branded podcast. Instead of running ads on someone else&#8217;s show, they&#8217;re investing in building their own audience.</p>
<p><strong>We want to make Transistor the best way to create a podcast for your business.</strong></p>
<p>We already have users!</p>

<p>Cards Against Humanity was our first paying customer. Their show, <a href="http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">The Good News Podcast</a>, is hosted on Transistor.</p>
<p>Since launching the beta in December, we&#8217;re hosting a handful of shows, and have already served 2 million podcast downloads.</p>
<p>We aim to help companies overcome the challenges of making a podcast. We want to help them create compelling content, build a podcast website, format their feed correctly, find listeners, and get a good return on their investment.</p>

<p>One thing that excites me, especially for <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/motivation/">Tiny Wins</a> customers, is that I&#8217;ll be able to use Transistor as a live case study for my tutorials. Everything I&#8217;m learning and applying on my SaaS, I&#8217;ll be sharing.</p>

<h2>
  What affects customer motivation?</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>Typically, when I&#8217;m at Safeway, you&#8217;ll find me in the cereal aisle, checking to see if Cheerios are on sale. I have four kids, and cereal is pretty expensive, so I almost always buy what&#8217;s on sale.</p>
<p>If I get to the checkout and I&#8217;ve saved $5, I feel like I&#8217;ve succeeded.</p>
<p>But today was different.</p>
<p>It was the night before Valentine&#8217;s Day, and like twenty other men, I was in the floral section looking for the perfect bouquet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a special trip. I&#8217;m walking around with intensity. It&#8217;s crowded; I&#8217;m jostling for position as other men scurry around. I&#8217;m not looking at price tags, but rather which arrangements &#8220;feel&#8221; right. I&#8217;m <strong>highly motivated</strong> to find the right flowers for someone I love.</p>
<p>Buying flowers is a lot different than buying Cheerios.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different is the <strong>emotion</strong> behind the purchase. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, price is no object. Lovers will spend significant amounts on flowers, dinner, and gifts. Why? They&#8217;re motivated to show affection to their partner.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredible how motivation can change behavior. Even a price-conscious customer will jump over hurdles, bypass objections, and get to the sale faster when they&#8217;re motivated.</p>
<h3>How motivated is your customer?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling Cheerios, and they&#8217;re not on sale, maybe I&#8217;ll buy oatmeal instead.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re selling the last seats to a Valentine&#8217;s Day Symphony, and my spouse wants to go, you better believe I&#8217;m motivated to get those tickets (and pay whatever it takes).</p>
<p>This principle also applies to selling software. I see many developers selling apps to unmotivated customers. If you&#8217;re tugging, pulling, and begging people to try your product, you have a motivation problem.</p>
<p>The smartest founders look for people already in motion, who are highly motivated to find a solution for an obstacle in their life.</p>
<h3>A story: Stripe</h3>
<p>Getting a merchant account used to be hard. You would have to fill out lengthy forms, fax them in, get background checks, and pay high applications fees. The crazy thing? People were doing it! That&#8217;s how motivated they were to accept payments online.</p>
<p>The Collison brothers noticed this and formed <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. They targeted a highly motivated group and made it easier for them to get what they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I really want to get this store online. Oh, damn, I need to fill out this 40-page document, and wait six weeks to get a merchant account?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Now:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I really want to get this store online. Oh sweet! All I need to do is sign up for Stripe, and 30 seconds later, I&#8217;m accepting credit cards!</p></blockquote>
<p>The customer is still highly motivated, but Stripe has just made it easier for them to make progress.</p>
<h3>What affects customer motivation?</h3>
<p>Here are a few factors to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Societal context: </strong>YouTube beat iFilm, even though iFilm was first. The problem? iFilm launched in 1997 when most consumers were still using dial-up (the 56k modem came out in &#8217;97). YouTube started in 2005, right when broadband was exploding. Over the next year, high-speed internet grew 40% in North America. The time was right for online video.</li>
<li><strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Personal context: </strong>As we go through different phases of life, our motivation changes. <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/principlesmarketing/chapter/3-1-factors-that-influence-consumers-buying-behavior/">In this textbook</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, the authors observe that &#8220;w</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">hen you were a child, the last thing you probably wanted as a gift was clothing. As you became a teen, however, cool clothes probably became a bigger priority.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><strong>Reference groups:</strong> If all your peers are on Snapchat, you&#8217;ll be more motivated to be there too. And, if everyone leaves for Instagram, you&#8217;ll likely follow. We tend to mirror the people we identify with. It&#8217;s also true in business: notice how many startups moved their blogs to Medium, or have started using live chat on their homepage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Timing is crucial. You don&#8217;t want to offer a product too early, and you don&#8217;t want to be too late. It&#8217;s usually best to be a bit ahead of the curve.</p>
<h3>How to find motivated customers</h3>
<p>Look for people in motion!</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they searching for answers on Google?</li>
<li>Are they asking for recommendations in Slack?</li>
<li>Are they sharing hacks and workarounds in private groups?</li>
<li>Are they hiring contractors and employees to get the task done?</li>
<li>Are they willing to jump through hoops, just to make the progress they desire?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t waste your time trying to convince unmotivated customers.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on folks who have a strong inward urge to get what they want.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

  I spent $30,000 to get product-market fit</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>It was 10pm on a Friday night. I was sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop open.</p>
<p>I was watching hundreds of Stripe payment notifications come through:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1762" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/annual/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/annual.jpg?fit=719%2C317&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="719,317" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Stripe payment notifications in macOs menu bar via CashNotify" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/annual.jpg?fit=500%2C220&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/annual.jpg?fit=600%2C265&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1762" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/annual.jpg?resize=600%2C265&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stripe payment notifications in macOs menu bar via CashNotify" width="600" height="265" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/annual.jpg?w=719&amp;ssl=1 719w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/annual.jpg?resize=500%2C220&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Thousands of dollars were pouring into my account.</p>
<p>And I was miserable.</p>
<p>A year previous, I&#8217;d launched a new subscription product called <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>.</p>
<p>People loved it. I&#8217;d received tons of <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/reviews/">good reviews</a>.</p>
<p>But now it was renewal time. And I started getting emails:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to circumstances, I wasn&#8217;t able to take full advantage of TMW last year. This year, I have laid out plans to go from working &#8220;in&#8221; my business to actually changing things around and making progress. But I haven&#8217;t finished last year&#8217;s courses. Do I really need to pay again?</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Also common:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry, Justin, I had forgotten this was a yearly subscription. I&#8217;m happy with the current version, but I&#8217;m only 50% finished. Could you refund this second payment?</p></blockquote>
<p>As more emails came in, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach: &#8220;this isn&#8217;t working.&#8221;</p>
<h3>What went wrong?</h3>
<p>Tiny Wins started as a free 14-day drip email sequence. Every day, I&#8217;d send you a new marketing tip.</p>

<p>It launched on Product Hunt on Oct 29, 2015. Nearly four thousand people signed up.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>After the 14 days was over, people asked me if I was going to keep doing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way I&#8217;d be able to keep doing it is if it was a paid subscription,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We&#8217;ll pay!&#8221; my subscribers said.</strong></p>
<p>I sat on the idea for awhile but finally launched a paid subscription in February 2017.</p>
<p>True to form, hundreds of people paid $249 for a year&#8217;s subscription.</p>
<p>I started sending them weekly marketing tutorial (video + pdf), and they tracked their progress inside the app:</p>

<h3>User feedback + iteration</h3>
<p>In the first few months, I noticed that people were completing the tactics much slower than I&#8217;d anticipated:</p>
<p><a href="https://wpcomplete.co/?ref=9"><img data-attachment-id="1769" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/completion-rates/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?fit=1944%2C760&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1944,760" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="WPComplete completion rates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?fit=500%2C195&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?fit=600%2C234&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1769" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?resize=600%2C234&#038;ssl=1" alt="WPComplete completion rates" width="600" height="234" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?resize=1024%2C400&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?resize=500%2C195&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?resize=768%2C300&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/completion-rates.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I started talking to my users and doing surveys. The results proved my suspicion:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1766" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/initial-tweet/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?fit=475%2C267&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="475,267" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Survey results: &#8220;show me how to create a Facebook ad,&#8221; &#8220;help me implement basic SEO,&#8221; &#8220;train me on Google Analytics&#8221;" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?fit=475%2C267&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?fit=475%2C267&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1766" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?resize=475%2C267&#038;ssl=1" alt="Survey results: &quot;show me how to create a Facebook ad,&quot; &quot;help me implement basic SEO,&quot; &quot;train me on Google Analytics&quot;" width="475" height="267" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>So, I tweaked the product to be focused on functional categories. I improved the dashboard as well:</p>

<p>The feedback from users was good:</p>

<p>People liked the new format. It also helped me (as the creator) think about specific outcomes my users needed, and respond to those directly.</p>
<p>But that still left a big question&#8230;</p>
<h3>What about the business model?</h3>
<p>The original idea with Tiny Wins is that I&#8217;d send users a new marketing tactic every seven days. That meant recording a new video tutorial and creating the handbook PDF, every week.</p>
<p>As 2017 came to an end, I took another look at individual completion rates:</p>

<p>In retrospect, this makes sense. What solopreneur has time to implement a new marketing tactic every week?</p>
<p>As I was pondering all of this, the annual renewals I was referring to earlier started coming through.</p>
<p>My stomach started to sink.</p>
<p>Once I started receiving refund requests, I knew: this wasn&#8217;t going to work as a subscription service.</p>
<p>I had to make a decision.</p>
<p>So, that Friday night, I manually refunded hundreds of payments. <strong>In total, I refunded about $30,000.</strong></p>
<p>I emailed users to tell them I was canceling all annual renewals. They&#8217;d still be able to access the content, and I was going to think about my next steps.</p>
<h3>Right product, wrong business model</h3>
<p>Sending that email, and refunding all those charges, was one of the hardest things I had to do.</p>
<p>But, I started hearing from customers right away:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1770" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/cancel-encouragement/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?fit=696%2C266&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="696,266" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="A cancelled user sends encouragement" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?fit=500%2C191&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?fit=600%2C229&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?resize=600%2C229&#038;ssl=1" alt="A cancelled user sends encouragement" width="600" height="229" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?w=696&amp;ssl=1 696w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?resize=500%2C191&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Customers liked the product; they didn&#8217;t like the business model.</p>
<p>I wrote about this threat <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/saas/">back in 2016</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many founders choose SaaS just because you want the recurring revenue. But just because you like the model as a founder, doesn’t mean it’s the right model for your customers, your product, your niche, or the current market conditions!</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, my customers were used to paying <strong>once</strong> for online courses. But here, they had to pay annually, and once their plan expired, they no longer had access.</p>
<h3>Pivoting to lifetime access</h3>
<p>After listening to customer feedback, I decided to try a new business model:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Tiny Marketing Wins is an awesome list of marketing tutorials. And now, you pay once for lifetime access.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I sent out the announcement email. Here&#8217;s what I heard back:</p>

<p>Already, 102 people have registered for <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/register/">lifetime access</a>.</p>
<p>It cost me $30,000 in refunds, but I feel like I may have cracked product-market fit. My plan now is to slowly add new tactics (probably 1-2 a month) to the list.</p>
<p>Currently, folks have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can buy my Tiny Wins courses <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/">individually</a> (currently $600+ in total)</li>
<li>They can get lifetime access to Tiny Wins for under $300.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">check out the new Tiny Marketing Wins here</a>. Until Feb 28, 2018, get $50 off lifetime access with the code <code>relaunch</code>.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Justin Jackson<br />
