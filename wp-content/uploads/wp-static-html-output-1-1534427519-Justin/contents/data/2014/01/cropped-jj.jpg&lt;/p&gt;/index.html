  Bootstrapper&#8217;s paradox</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>In 2013, I <a href="http://www.productpeople.tv/episodes/ep33-jason-calacanis-of-inside-com-talks-about-bootstrapping-vs-funding">interviewed Jason Calacanis</a>, the angel investor.</p>
<p>I asked him: &#8220;Why do venture capital investors take these big risks with their money?&#8221;</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lot of money in the world. There are trillions of dollars just sitting around, and people are bored. The money is bored! Money wants to burn! Money does not want to sit in a safe.</p></blockquote>
<p>What an interesting idea: &#8220;the money is bored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jon Buda and I are bootstrapping <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a> and <a href="https://spots.fm">Spots.fm</a>. We&#8217;ve invested our own money into both of these projects.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re self-funding a startup, your money is the opposite of bored. Your money is stressed.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re caught between these two realities: you&#8217;re investing real time and money into the product, but the product isn&#8217;t yet giving you anything back.</p>
<h3>SaaS launch example</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re launching Transistor.fm on August 1st.</p>
<p>Currently, we have 51 early access customers and $781 in MRR.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that after we launch we double MRR to $1,500.</p>
<p>To get to $21,000 in MRR (enough for Jon and me to focus on Transistor full-time), it will take five years (assuming 10.0% exponential growth and 5.0% churn).</p>

<p>Five years. 60 months. That&#8217;s a long time to wait for a paycheque. Once Transistor hits $20,000 a month, that&#8217;s dependable, recurring revenue. With that kind of MRR, Transistor also becomes a valuable, saleable asset.</p>
<p>But at the beginning, before the product has proven itself, it&#8217;s all a big risk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why bootstrapped founders get stressed. It&#8217;s easy to see why many experience burnout and have to quit.</p>
<p>Bootstrappers who are building something new have to walk this fine line:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to invest a considerable amount of effort to launch our product.</li>
<li>But we also need money to live, and it can be years before a SaaS can support you full-time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basecamp&#8217;s bootstrapping model</h3>
<p>All of this has me thinking about <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p>
<p>What Jason Fried and DHH achieved is what most bootstrappers aspire for. Heck, most of us would be happy for even a fraction of their success.</p>
<p>Basecamp has long been the example of how you can self-fund a product, bring it to market, grow it, and have it succeed.</p>
<p>But the story we&#8217;ve been telling ourselves about Basecamp and bootstrapping isn&#8217;t quite right.</p>
<p>In 2006 David and Jason did something many of us have ignored.</p>
<p>They took investment!</p>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://www.startups.co/articles/build-a-kick-ass-startup?ref=quuu&amp;utm_source=quuu">this interview</a> with DHH on Startup.co. The interviewer asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you&#8217;ve built Basecamp you&#8217;ve been very vocal about resisting the temptation of unicorn culture. How have your perspectives changed?</p></blockquote>
<p>David&#8217;s answer is interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>It wasn&#8217;t without temptation or struggle to stay like this. Especially in the early years, before our bombastic views on venture capital, the IPO rat-race, and other ills of funding were known. We had, I think, close to 50 different VCs get in contact.</p>
<p>Ironically, part of what did give us the confidence to turn down that whole world was a small sale of equity to Jeff Bezos. That gave our personal bank accounts just enough ballast that the big numbers touted by VCs and acquisition hunters lost their lure.</p></blockquote>
<p>37signals, the poster child of the bootstrapped world, took investment two years after they launched the product.</p>
<p>That Bezos money didn&#8217;t go into the company. It went into their personal bank accounts.</p>
<p>It was insurance money.</p>
<p>Jason and David were able to hedge their bets. That Bezos investment removed a lot of the stress and risk that comes from bootstrapping a product.</p>
<p>Bootstrappers have created a religion out of building something from scratch and self-funding the entire thing.</p>
<p>But what if that ideology leads to burnout? Or bankruptcy? Or not being able to go the distance?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s David again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>I really wish that more founders who are on to something could find ways to diversify their accounts just enough to dare go the distance.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s something we need to think about.</p>

<p>Yeah, so I work for myself, and I can kind of spend my time doing whatever I want to do as long as it pays off down the road. I&#8217;ve done a bunch of different stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote the &#8220;Refactoring to collections&#8221; book</li>
<li>I did the Test-Driven Laravel course</li>
<li>Most recently I did like the &#8220;Advanced Vue.js&#8221; course.</li>
<li>I have a podcast and I have sponsors for that.</li>
<li>I have a CSS framework call Tailwind that earns a little bit of money from ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, all that stuff felt like scattered ideas. I always have to know what my next project is while I&#8217;m working on the current project. I&#8217;m just hoping that I&#8217;ll have an idea to put after the next one. It feels like I&#8217;m building the bridge as I&#8217;m like walking across it.</p>
<p>And in the back of my head, I&#8217;m always trying to figure out: &#8220;What do I actually want to be doing long-term?&#8221; Because all these things feel like temporary little projects.</p>
<p>For example, the Vue.js course: I took maybe eight weeks of actual work. (Obviously, I had to learn the ideas and everything for years before that). But the actual work of deciding to build it, putting up a landing page, and recording the videos, that was an eight-week project.</p>
<p>A lot of my projects feel like that. They&#8217;re these temporary things that I get an influx of income from.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m always trying to figure out: &#8220;what do I actually want to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dream for me has always been to make some sort of SaaS or something, right? I want to be able to sit down, work on features for a product, put it out there, get users, and be able to just focus on one thing and grow it for many years. I feel like I&#8217;m always chasing that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get into a little bit of a funk. It&#8217;s usually a few weeks after I finish a project, and before I&#8217;ve started on the next one, where I don&#8217;t have a focus.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m working on a course or a book, it feels like I have this purpose. I&#8217;m like: &#8220;Okay. This is the thing that I&#8217;m doing. This is what&#8217;s occupying my mind,&#8221; and I can just hustle on that.</p>
<p>But when it&#8217;s done I get back into this mode where I&#8217;m thinking: &#8220;Okay, so what&#8217;s next? What am I gonna be working on long-term?&#8221; and it just gets me in the spot where go down this hole:</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, I want to make a SaaS. What sort of SaaS could I make?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of scratch-my-itch problems do I have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I just imagine an idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of developers have probably felt the same thing, where you&#8217;re trying to brainstorm and force yourself to come up with some innovative thing that&#8217;s going to be a successful business.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s never going to be that easy. You&#8217;re never going to be able to just sit and like force your brain to invent some amazing idea, you know?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard because I feel like I have to keep thinking about it to try and figure it out. But at the same time, I know there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to come up with something trying to invent some idea. It can be really disheartening.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t know. What do you think about this?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this question: &#8220;Is that what I&#8217;ll be known for? Is it enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>In some ways, I liked it better when 37signals had a bunch of ongoing projects because it was easy to say: &#8220;Cool, they&#8217;ve got a bunch of projects; I&#8217;ve got a bunch of projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then they doubled-down on Basecamp. They said, &#8220;this is our best idea. This is our life&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>That creates this pressure for us because those guys are our heroes. Their move to focus on Basecamp made me panic a bit: &#8220;Dang. Ok, what&#8217;s my best idea? What&#8217;s my life&#8217;s work going to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>That kind of pressure is terrible for creativity. We lock ourselves in a closet and say, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not getting out of this closet until I&#8217;ve got a good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s so dumb though. How many good ideas are created in that &#8220;locked in the closet&#8221; scenario? Very few. It just doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p>
<p>As an aside, it&#8217;s interesting for me to be looking at this as your friend. Because from the outside, you&#8217;re clearly good at what you do (helping developers).</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re dealing with this stuff personally, you can&#8217;t see the forest through the trees. It&#8217;s hard to get a sense of the bigger picture. But the people who are around you can see clearly. When you&#8217;re in the forest, and all you can see is the trees, you need folks who can help you zoom out and look at the big picture.</p>
<p>It sounds like Derek Sivers&#8217; book, &#8220;Anything You Want,&#8221; was kind of your sage, helping you zoom out, hey?</p>

<p>Yeah, I can talk about that a little bit. So the book, &#8220;Anything You Want,&#8221; is Derek Sivers&#8217; story and lessons learned from running CD Baby. It all the philosophies he took away from that experience.</p>

<p>Exactly. Haha, so anyways, I&#8217;ve read this book multiple times. It&#8217;s one of those books, where every time I read it there&#8217;s a different message in it for me, depending on where I&#8217;m at with what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>This time, I had this realization: Derek, at his core, he&#8217;s a musician right? That&#8217;s where CD Baby came from. He&#8217;s a musician. He wanted to sell his CDs online, and he just figured out a way to do it. His friends wanted him to do it for them too. And the next thing you know, he has this successful business that he didn&#8217;t plan on.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is he didn&#8217;t go into this problem as a software developer. He didn&#8217;t want to start a software company or a CD warehousing company.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a musician and his buddies are musicians and he had musician problems and wanted to make being a musician better. Starting CD Baby was the way he ended up doing that.</p>
<p>That was my main takeaway: his business was really just helping musicians. That&#8217;s what the mission was. It wasn&#8217;t about any idea. It came from him saying: &#8220;I care about helping musicians be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something about that really flipped my perspective.</p>
<p>Like I kind of mentioned, all the stuff I do kind of feels scattered. I have a bunch of educational products right? Then I have some open source stuff that I want to pursue. I also do some live-streaming stuff. And they&#8217;ve all felt like these isolated projects. They&#8217;re not pushing in one obvious direction.</p>
<p>What this book made me realize this time is that I was thinking too much about the category, instead of the job I was trying to solve by creating things in that category. It made me realize I don&#8217;t have to be in the business of creating education products. I don&#8217;t have to exist in that category. I have to think: &#8220;why am I making these courses?&#8221; I&#8217;m making them because I want to help software developers have more fun at their jobs, write code that they&#8217;re happy with, and build better stuff, faster.</p>
<p>When I flip that around and look at it from that lens, then it removes any guilt that I had about building something that wasn&#8217;t a video course. For example, my framework is totally solving that same problem for those same people. And it&#8217;s in a totally different category than any sort of educational thing.</p>

<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ve talked about this a lot: &#8220;don&#8217;t start with an idea start with people.&#8221; You told me you remember me saying that stuff, but that this time around there was a new insight.</p>
<h4><a href="http://twitter.com/adamwathan"><img data-attachment-id="1832" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/who/adam-tiny/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/07/adam-tiny.png?fit=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="32,32" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="adam-tiny" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/07/adam-tiny.png?fit=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/07/adam-tiny.png?fit=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1832" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/07/adam-tiny.png?resize=32%2C32&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="32" height="32" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Adam Wathan:</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to explain. Yes, I&#8217;ve heard you talk about it before and it&#8217;s obviously great advice, but I think I took it as: &#8220;you don&#8217;t want to build something for people who can&#8217;t sustain your business. You don&#8217;t want to make like hobbyist software for hobbyist photographers who don&#8217;t actually have revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve always looked at that advice from a cold, clinical perspective: &#8220;make sure the market you&#8217;re choosing as money.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new insight is that my business isn&#8217;t about &#8220;the idea.&#8221; My business is helping whatever group of people I decide to help make progress with whatever their problems are. And doing that can take the form of just about anything as long as I&#8217;m still focused on the same group.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot to unpack with this idea of &#8220;choosing your market first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you want to choose a market that pays for things and is easy to reach.</p>
<p>But you also want &#8220;founder-market fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Product-market fit is a good market and a product that satisfies that market. But founder-market is about finding a market that you really want to help.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly motivating to wake up every day and go: &#8220;Okay, who am I trying to serve?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re building something, and you like who you&#8217;re building it for, it&#8217;s energizing. You&#8217;re going to have a much better time. That energy will sustain you on the days where you&#8217;re not feeling particularly creative.</p>

<p>So you could have this feeling of: &#8220;Well that sucks because I&#8217;ve invested all this time in it.&#8221; Some people are so in love with their idea that they can&#8217;t let it go. They&#8217;ll say: &#8220;This is my baby, I&#8217;m holding on to this forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you can say: &#8220;Well that sucks, but my mission is to help developers make things they&#8217;re proud of. So if a better solution comes along, that&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your mission is about helping the people, not your particular implementation.</p>

<p>Exactly, look at newspapers. Their mission was to deliver the news to people. Their product <em>was </em>printing it and delivering it. But then the internet came along, and a lot of newspapers got killed.</p>
<p>However, the New York Times evolved. They have a giant tech team doing innovative stuff. They didn&#8217;t just latch on to this sentiment of &#8220;we need to get people reading this paper! Maybe if we make the paper smell better more people will want to buy our paper!&#8221;</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t get too attached to the implementation.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a strategy piece to this too.</p>
<p>If you enjoy serving a particular customer and you get to know them better than anybody else you&#8217;ll earn a reputation. And a good reputation is very difficult to duplicate. It&#8217;s a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Even if a competitor comes along and steals a piece of your business, you&#8217;ll still have a big asset. You know your customers better than anybody else. Plus: they know who <em>you </em>are.</p>
<p>Founders should be motivated to help their customers no matter what the medium is. It could be a course, software, or a conference talk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a freeing way to live your life. Instead of getting attached to one idea, you can just move on to the next thing because you&#8217;re still passionate about the people.</p>

<p>Yeah, one hundred percent.</p>

<p>I also wonder: in a competitive environment, is this is the only approach that works?</p>
<p>For example, if someone came along that cared more about Laravel programmers than you do, they would probably kick your ass.</p>
<p>But the reason you&#8217;re killing it is that you&#8217;ve been doing this forever. Whether it was helping somebody fix a problem in a forum, or helping someone on Twitter, you&#8217;ve been doing this for a long time. You have a heritage. It&#8217;s in your DNA.</p>
<p>For someone to unseat you, they&#8217;re going to need to have that same DNA, history, and passion. Nobody can just start out and compete with Adam Wathan. It takes years of investment.</p>

<p>Yeah, I totally agree.</p>
<p>This perspective has also helped me disqualify certain ideas for products.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been sitting around brainstorming: &#8220;What am I going to build? What problems do I have? What tools could I make?&#8221;</p>
<p>But now I can see a lot of my ideas would mean helping a totally different group of people; people that I&#8217;m not necessarily motivated to help.</p>

<p>This is something Seth Godin hits on all the time. He asks two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is it for?</li>
<li>What is it for?</li>
</ol>
<p>So you could come up with an idea, and ask: &#8220;Ok, who is it for?&#8221; Maybe the idea is for &#8220;course creators.&#8221; Well, you know that doesn&#8217;t fit your mission of helping developers.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for developers, you could ask: &#8220;Ok, what is it for?&#8221; And that&#8217;s where you see if your idea fits with your mission of making developers happier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great checklist for ideas. Be honest about &#8220;who it&#8217;s for&#8221; and &#8220;what it&#8217;s for&#8221; and make sure that aligns with you and what you want out of your life.</p>

<p>I was born in Edmonton, and every once in awhile, I go back for a visit.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m in town, I almost always go for coffee with my buddy Tim. He&#8217;s about my age, and he&#8217;s just incredible at sales. Over the years, he&#8217;s pushed himself to build relationships with big brands. He thinks big, and that&#8217;s what I like about him.</p>
<p><iframe src='https://share.transistor.fm/e/28f022a7' width='100%' height='180' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' seamless='true'></iframe></p>
<p>I like to meet with Tim because he gets me to think outside my box. In business, we need people like this: folks who are a few steps ahead of us, who push us to get better.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my situation: I&#8217;ve been running this little solopreneur business for two years. I&#8217;m doing everything. Whenever I come up with an idea, I design the website, and I write the content. If there&#8217;s programming that needs to be done, I&#8217;ll try to do it myself.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m meeting Tim, he says: &#8220;why are you doing all that work yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m a solopreneur,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;we do it all. That&#8217;s our mantra.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Tim replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In my business, I&#8217;ve learned its best if I&#8217;m not doing everything. I&#8217;m good at coming up with the vision. But the only way for me to grow is to partner with (or hire) people who can help me do the work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Trying to do it all&#8221; is one of my weaknesses. I&#8217;m realizing, that by forcing myself to be a solopreneur, I&#8217;ve been slowing myself down.</p>
<p>How many successful businesses were genuinely built by solopreneurs?</p>
<p>Walt needed Roy to build Disney. Jason Fried partnered with DHH to build Basecamp. Macklemore collaborated with Ryan Lewis to produce his breakthrough album, The Heist.</p>
<p>Greatness is almost never a solo endeavor.</p>
<p>Maybe, you (and I) shouldn&#8217;t be a solopreneurs.</p>
<hr />
<p>In January, I co-founded Transistor.fm with my friend Jon Buda.</p>
<p>Jon is a talented full-stack web developer. He can he can do all the backend stuff, but he&#8217;s also a pretty good web designer too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what surprised me since Jon and I teamed up: I can&#8217;t believe how fast we can move together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like I have a superpower because I don&#8217;t have to do all the work myself. If I had to build Transistor on my own, it would take me forever. But now, Jon can focus on his strengths, and I can focus on mine. It feels like I&#8217;m running at full-speed in my lane, and I look over, and Jon&#8217;s right there with me, running in his.</p>
<p>Another benefit? Entrepreneurship is a hard road. It&#8217;s emotional work. It&#8217;s nice to have someone to help you bear the load when things get tough.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being a solopreneur doesn&#8217;t mean doing 100% of everything yourself. The most successful solo-founders get outside help (contractors, freelancers, partnerships).</li>
<li>Most of us weren&#8217;t meant to be solopreneurs. Entrepreneurship is hard; having the right partner helps.</li>
<li>To succeed in business: leverage your strengths and partner with/hire folks who fill out your weak spots.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>Do any of these sound familiar?</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I ordered the book, but never read it.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I bought this app, but I never logged in.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I backed it on Kickstarter, but it just sat in its box.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I got the upgrade, but I kept using the old version.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>As product people, we make things so people will use them.</p>
<p>And yet, we optimize a lot of our marketing around merely getting the sale.</p>
<p><strong>But &#8220;getting the sale&#8221; isn’t enough.</strong></p>
<p>You can’t build a sustainable business on one sale. You need customers to come back; otherwise, you’re wasting a lot of time, money, and energy on acquisition.</p>
<p>The truth is, most of the magic happens immediately after purchase. When customers buy something and become activated, that’s where our business’ flywheel starts running.</p>
<p>Customer activation leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive outcomes for your users</li>
<li>word of mouth, reviews, and case studies</li>
<li>repeat purchases, upgrades, and expansion revenue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activation and usage are what contributes to a business’ longevity.</strong> Instead of being in a never-ending cycle of trying to acquire customers, you’re able to focus on retention. This increases the lifetime value of a customer.</p>
<p>For example, my friend Bryce owns the local skateboard shop. It doesn&#8217;t help him if he sells someone a board, and they go home and put it in their closet. To have a healthy business long-term, he needs the customer to use the skateboard, and keep using it!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, two girls bought their first skateboard. Yesterday, Bryce and I were hanging out in his shop, and they rode by down Main street. This is a good sign. They’re out skateboarding. They’re activated!</p>
<p>If they keep skating, they’ll progress. They’ll break boards. They’ll buy new shoes. They’ll want to upgrade to better wheels. Tony Hawk is 50 years old, so it’s possible that these girls will skateboard for another 35 years. These are the long-term customers that will help Bryce build and sustain his business.</p>
<h3>How do you increase activation?</h3>
<p>Those first moments after the purchase are crucial. Remember, when a customer signs up, they’re highly motivated. They’re eager to see if your product will live up to its hype. They’re asking:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Alright, I’m in! What’s this going to do for me?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But, if your product feels too complicated, or they get stuck too fast, they’re going to give up. And if they leave, you might never get them back.</p>
<p>So, when users log in for the first time, you need to give them a quick win.</p>
<p>Rob Walling calls this the “minimum path to awesome:”</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you have invoicing software, maybe it’s when they send their first invoice, maybe it’s when they get paid. It&#8217;s the minimum path from sign-up to something that gives them a dopamine rush.&#8221; – Rob Walling (<a href="https://www.profitwell.com/blog/double-your-trial-to-paid-conversion-rate-with-onboarding">Source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>If your product is new, one way to give customers that feeling is to personally onboard them. Get on the phone! At the beginning of the call, you can determine:</p>
<ol>
<li>What’s going on in their world that brought them to your product today?</li>
<li>What are they hoping to accomplish with your product?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The biggest mistake I see new SaaS companies making is they try to increase activation by writing lots of onboarding code and emails. Instead, screen share with every new customer. Figure out why they bought your product and what their goals are. Personally help them &#8220;activate&#8221; what you promised them on your marketing site.&#8221; – Brennan Dunn</p></blockquote>
<p>For my new startup, Transistor.fm, we’ve done dozens of calls with early-access users. What are we seeing? Two accomplishments make our users feel awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uploading their first podcast episode</li>
<li>Being able to share it with a friend</li>
</ol>
<p>Folks want to be able to tweet out: &#8220;HEY! I JUST MADE A PODCAST CHECK IT OUT!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Don’t be satisfied with just taking people’s money. Reach out. Figure out what their goals are, and where they’re getting stuck. Then, help activate them by giving them some initial wins.</p>

<h2>
  Don&#8217;t sell to beginners</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>Jon Buda and I are getting closer to launching <a href="https://transistor.fm">our SaaS</a>, and that means we need to figure out pricing. We realized a lot of pricing depends on <strong>who you&#8217;re selling to</strong>. Should we sell to startups? Should we aim at the enterprise? Hobbyists?</p>
<p>We reached out to Patrick at Price Intelligently to help walk us through the pricing process.</p>
<p>During our chat, Patrick said, &#8220;In your early stage two things are essential; if you can nail these two things (even if you get everything else wrong) you&#8217;re typically fine.&#8221; According to him, the two things to focus on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your customer focus</li>
<li>Your value metric (I&#8217;ll talk about this in a future post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing your target customer is incredibly important. &#8220;From the beginning, you want to figure out who is going to be a sustainable, profitable customer,&#8221; says Patrick &#8220;it&#8217;s going to determine how you do your marketing, and also how you&#8217;re going to structure your pricing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick helped me realize something:</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re bootstrapping, you shouldn&#8217;t sell to beginners, new startups, or hobbyists.</strong></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re building a company, there&#8217;s an inclination to sell to folks who are &#8220;just getting started:&#8221; new companies, people building their skill set, beginners. After all, they need the most help, right? But increasingly, I see this as a trap.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&#8220;Selling to your startup friends probably won&#8217;t be profitable,&#8221; comments Patrick. Startups and beginner customers might be easy to attract (they sign up for free newsletters, guides, and free tools), but they have three significant downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>They&#8217;ll use free tools and resources if they can.</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t have the same capacity to pay as experts do.</li>
<li>Most new startups fail, so they don&#8217;t make stable, long-term customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply put, it&#8217;s hard to build a sustainable business for beginners. They can&#8217;t pay as much, and they don&#8217;t stick around as long, which results in a lower lifetime value.</p>
<p><strong>In B2B, it&#8217;s the intermediate to advanced companies who need our help and will pay you for a long time.</strong></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve proven they can survive the startup stage. But now they&#8217;ve exhausted all of their free resources, and they&#8217;re starting to plateau. To get to the next level, they&#8217;re going to need outside help, and because they have revenue, they can afford to pay for it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Targeting beginners requires you to do more work on the periphery of your core skill set. When you get hyper-focused on what you do best + combine it with supporting intermediate/advanced businesses, you love your work and get paid well for it.&#8221;<br />
– Val Geisler, <a href="http://valgeisler.com">valgeisler.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The best target market is &#8220;professionals who are already heading in a specific direction.&#8221; They&#8217;re in motion towards a specific goal.</p>
<p>For example, my friend Brennan&#8217;s company (<a href="https://rightmessage.com?fp_ref=justin12">RightMessage</a>) is almost at <a href="https://rightmessage.baremetrics.com/">$20k in MRR</a>. They&#8217;ve proven they have traction. My guess is their first milestone is to reach $5 million a year in revenue.</p>
<p>To accomplish that goal, they&#8217;re going to need specific assistance. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Help me increase sales by 30%.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Teach me how to podcast so that I can reach a bigger audience.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Take away my downtime.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Equip me to design better onboarding flows.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;re going to hire outside help to assist them with these things; to help them get to their goal.</p>
<p>One way to visualize this is a delivery truck driving towards a destination:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1811" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/beginners/truck-01/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?fit=1538%2C286&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1538,286" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="truck-01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?fit=500%2C93&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?fit=600%2C111&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1811" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?resize=600%2C111&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="111" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?resize=1024%2C190&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?resize=500%2C93&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?resize=768%2C143&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?w=1538&amp;ssl=1 1538w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-01.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Along the way, a rockslide covers the road:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1812" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/beginners/truck-02/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?fit=1540%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1540,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="truck-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?fit=500%2C156&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?fit=600%2C187&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1812" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=600%2C187&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="187" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=1024%2C319&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=500%2C156&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=768%2C239&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?w=1540&amp;ssl=1 1540w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Who are they going to call?</p>
<p>(If you yelled out ROCKBUSTERS, you and I could be friends)</p>
<p>To me, B2B products and services we build are a lot like that. We&#8217;re removing obstacles for businesses, helping them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>But targetting the right customer is critical. For example, the delivery company has already proven a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&#8217;re investing heavily in their equipment (the delivery truck).</li>
<li>They&#8217;re investing in their personnel (trained truck drivers).</li>
<li>They have high-value customers who can pay them to haul big loads over long distances.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re committed to building a company for the long-term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that with a solo bike courier who is just getting started:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1813" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/beginners/truck-03/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?fit=1530%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1530,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="truck-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?fit=500%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?fit=600%2C188&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1813" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=600%2C188&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="188" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=1024%2C321&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=500%2C157&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=768%2C241&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?w=1530&amp;ssl=1 1530w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The biker courier is sending signals that show they probably wouldn&#8217;t make a great customer for a B2B business:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have minimal investment in their equipment (bicycle).</li>
<li>They&#8217;re likely serving low-value customers (short routes, small payments)</li>
<li>They probably don&#8217;t see themselves being a biker courier for 5-10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are all sorts of services the delivery truck company will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nitrous injections, to give their engines more power.</li>
<li>Roadside assistance, to get the truck back on the road.<br />
Logistics software, to map the fastest routes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the crazy thing: </strong>you and I could invest the same amount of energy building products for the truck company as the bike courier.</p>
<p>Sure, we can sell the cyclist PowerBars (for energy), roadside assistance, and a mapping app, but they don&#8217;t have the same capacity to pay.</p>
<p>As product people, we need to focus on the right customers. Let&#8217;s not invest in customers who might not be around in 6 months. Instead, let&#8217;s build things for professionals that help unlock their potential.</p>
