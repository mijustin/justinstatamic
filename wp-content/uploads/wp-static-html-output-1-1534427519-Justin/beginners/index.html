		<h2>
  Don&#8217;t sell to beginners</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>Jon Buda and I are getting closer to launching <a href="https://transistor.fm">our SaaS</a>, and that means we need to figure out pricing. We realized a lot of pricing depends on <strong>who you&#8217;re selling to</strong>. Should we sell to startups? Should we aim at the enterprise? Hobbyists?</p>
<p>We reached out to Patrick at Price Intelligently to help walk us through the pricing process.</p>
<p>During our chat, Patrick said, &#8220;In your early stage two things are essential; if you can nail these two things (even if you get everything else wrong) you&#8217;re typically fine.&#8221; According to him, the two things to focus on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your customer focus</li>
<li>Your value metric (I&#8217;ll talk about this in a future post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing your target customer is incredibly important. &#8220;From the beginning, you want to figure out who is going to be a sustainable, profitable customer,&#8221; says Patrick &#8220;it&#8217;s going to determine how you do your marketing, and also how you&#8217;re going to structure your pricing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick helped me realize something:</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re bootstrapping, you shouldn&#8217;t sell to beginners, new startups, or hobbyists.</strong></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re building a company, there&#8217;s an inclination to sell to folks who are &#8220;just getting started:&#8221; new companies, people building their skill set, beginners. After all, they need the most help, right? But increasingly, I see this as a trap.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&#8220;Selling to your startup friends probably won&#8217;t be profitable,&#8221; comments Patrick. Startups and beginner customers might be easy to attract (they sign up for free newsletters, guides, and free tools), but they have three significant downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>They&#8217;ll use free tools and resources if they can.</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t have the same capacity to pay as experts do.</li>
<li>Most new startups fail, so they don&#8217;t make stable, long-term customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply put, it&#8217;s hard to build a sustainable business for beginners. They can&#8217;t pay as much, and they don&#8217;t stick around as long, which results in a lower lifetime value.</p>
<p><strong>In B2B, it&#8217;s the intermediate to advanced companies who need our help and will pay you for a long time.</strong></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve proven they can survive the startup stage. But now they&#8217;ve exhausted all of their free resources, and they&#8217;re starting to plateau. To get to the next level, they&#8217;re going to need outside help, and because they have revenue, they can afford to pay for it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Targeting beginners requires you to do more work on the periphery of your core skill set. When you get hyper-focused on what you do best + combine it with supporting intermediate/advanced businesses, you love your work and get paid well for it.&#8221;<br />
– Val Geisler, <a href="http://valgeisler.com">valgeisler.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The best target market is &#8220;professionals who are already heading in a specific direction.&#8221; They&#8217;re in motion towards a specific goal.</p>
<p>For example, my friend Brennan&#8217;s company (<a href="https://rightmessage.com?fp_ref=justin12">RightMessage</a>) is almost at <a href="https://rightmessage.baremetrics.com/">$20k in MRR</a>. They&#8217;ve proven they have traction. My guess is their first milestone is to reach $5 million a year in revenue.</p>
<p>To accomplish that goal, they&#8217;re going to need specific assistance. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Help me increase sales by 30%.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Teach me how to podcast so that I can reach a bigger audience.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Take away my downtime.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Equip me to design better onboarding flows.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;re going to hire outside help to assist them with these things; to help them get to their goal.</p>
<p>One way to visualize this is a delivery truck driving towards a destination:</p>

<p>Along the way, a rockslide covers the road:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1812" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/beginners/truck-02/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?fit=1540%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1540,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="truck-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?fit=500%2C156&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?fit=600%2C187&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1812" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=600%2C187&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="187" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=1024%2C319&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=500%2C156&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?resize=768%2C239&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?w=1540&amp;ssl=1 1540w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-02.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Who are they going to call?</p>
<p>(If you yelled out ROCKBUSTERS, you and I could be friends)</p>
<p>To me, B2B products and services we build are a lot like that. We&#8217;re removing obstacles for businesses, helping them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>But targetting the right customer is critical. For example, the delivery company has already proven a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&#8217;re investing heavily in their equipment (the delivery truck).</li>
<li>They&#8217;re investing in their personnel (trained truck drivers).</li>
<li>They have high-value customers who can pay them to haul big loads over long distances.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re committed to building a company for the long-term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that with a solo bike courier who is just getting started:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1813" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/beginners/truck-03/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?fit=1530%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1530,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="truck-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?fit=500%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?fit=600%2C188&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1813" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=600%2C188&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="188" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=1024%2C321&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=500%2C157&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?resize=768%2C241&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?w=1530&amp;ssl=1 1530w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2018/06/truck-03.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The biker courier is sending signals that show they probably wouldn&#8217;t make a great customer for a B2B business:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have minimal investment in their equipment (bicycle).</li>
<li>They&#8217;re likely serving low-value customers (short routes, small payments)</li>
<li>They probably don&#8217;t see themselves being a biker courier for 5-10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are all sorts of services the delivery truck company will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nitrous injections, to give their engines more power.</li>
<li>Roadside assistance, to get the truck back on the road.<br />
Logistics software, to map the fastest routes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the crazy thing: </strong>you and I could invest the same amount of energy building products for the truck company as the bike courier.</p>
<p>Sure, we can sell the cyclist PowerBars (for energy), roadside assistance, and a mapping app, but they don&#8217;t have the same capacity to pay.</p>
<p>As product people, we need to focus on the right customers. Let&#8217;s not invest in customers who might not be around in 6 months. Instead, let&#8217;s build things for professionals that help unlock their potential.</p>
