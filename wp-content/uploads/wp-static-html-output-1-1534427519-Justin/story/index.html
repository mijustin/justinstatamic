  My story</h2>
<p>
  </p>

<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Justin Jackson. This is my story.</p>
<h3>In 1983</h3>
<p>My family got our first computer: a Commodore Vic-20. I was fascinated by it. I spent hours trying to figure out BASIC, and made a few little programs.</p>

<h3>In 1985</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My family flew from Alberta to Texas to visit my grandparents. We celebrated my fifth birthday there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My grandpa, who was a carpenter, gave me a tool box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  He tried</span> to teach me how to hammer a nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  I bent every one. I’ve never been good with building anything with my hands.</span></span></p>
<h3>In 1989</h3>
<p>We got our second computer: a <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue106/reviews_tandy.php">Tandy 1000 SL</a> from Radio Shack. It included some music making software, and the GW-BASIC editor. I started creating little songs and coding little programs.</p>
<h3 class="p1">In 1994</h3>
<p>I was 13. <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2013/09/justin-jackson-nerd-mullet.jpg">I looked like this</a>. I loved computers, and had begged my parents to buy me a 2400 BAUD modem. I immediately started calling local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> numbers. I lived on an acreage in Alberta (just outside of Edmonton) and found a BBS called <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/growth-hacker/">Absolute Future</a>. The owner of the BBS made me Co-SysOp, which I remember being a huge deal.</p>
<p>I was homeschooled (check out <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/contents/data/2013/09/justin-jackson-nerd-mullet.jpg">this haircut</a>). I did all my schoolwork on the computer, and spent a lot of time experimenting.</p>
<p>My parents&#8217; friend gave me access to the internet through the local university. I could use Telnet and Gopher to explore different servers. I also got access to UseNet groups (my faves were alt.hackers, alt.2600, and alt.binaries).</p>
<p>This was also the year I was introduced to Mosaic, the first GUI web browser. I was instantly intrigued by the web, and started fooling around with HTML.</p>
<h3>In 1998</h3>
<p>I turned 18, moved out of my parent&#8217;s home, and started going to college in Edmonton. I got a job as a bellboy at a hotel, but really wanted to start my own company.</p>
<p>The next summer I quit my job and created Mediahead Productions. I got a small BDC loan and bought a Pentium PC, and a Sony TRV-900 video camera. I paid the loan back by the end of the summer.</p>

<h3>In 1999</h3>
<p>One of my business ideas was to make videos at summer camps. I&#8217;d go and take video of camp activities, and at the end of the week I&#8217;d sell VHS tapes to campers for $20 each.</p>
<p>This is how I met my wife. I was making these camp videos, and she was a camp councillor. We started dating at the end of the summer.</p>
<h3>In 2001</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got married this year, and we&#8217;re still married. 😉</p>
<p>At this point, my little business was still paying my bills. I was doing a lot of website design and multimedia production. My original plan was to grow my company into a full studio.</p>
<p>But, plans changed.</p>
<p>For reasons that seem odd now, I became a youth pastor. I worked with teenagers for the next 7 years.</p>

<h3>In 2002</h3>
<p>A friend and I decided to start a skateboard and snowboard shop called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/9819590930/">The Real Deal</a>. My friend managed the shop. I was still working full-time, and would help out whenever I could.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070226200609/http://www.therealdeal.ca/sad.htm">In 2006 we decided to close it</a>. That year I almost had a breakdown. I wrote about the experience <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/the-principle-that-changed-my-life/">here</a>. At this point, my wife and decided we wouldn&#8217;t do anything else major on the side until our kids were in school.</p>

<h3>In 2008</h3>
<p>A pivotal year. I decided to look for a new job. I wanted to get back into technology work. I&#8217;d been away from the web for 7 years, and I was scared. I had a family to support, and my web skills were rusty. I was 28, and compared to the rest of the tech industry, already felt old.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/greggoldring">Gregg</a> gave me a great opportunity. He invited me to come work with him at <a href="http://mailout.com">Mailout</a>. The first day on the job, he introduced me to 37signals and their book, <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>.</p>
<p>Getting Real is the original manifesto written by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, and describes the philosophy they used to build Basecamp. Before this book, I had built a few &#8220;things&#8221; but had focused mostly on offering services. Now, I had a vision for building products.</p>
<h3>In 2012</h3>
<p>I went for a beer with a brilliant designer / developer named <a href="http://kylefox.ca/">Kyle Fox</a>. I&#8217;d just moved to Vernon, BC, and was back in Edmonton for business. When I flew back home, Kyle messaged me and said: &#8220;We should start a podcast about products.&#8221;</p>
<p>On October 2012, we recorded our first episode of <a href="http://productpeople.tv/">Product People</a>.</p>

<h3>In 2013</h3>
<p>I published <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/words.html">the most popular thing</a> I&#8217;ve ever written. It was also the year I released my first solo project in years: a little guide called <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/book/amplification/">Amplification</a>. Soon after, I started a private community called <a href="http://jfdi.bz/campfire/">JFDI</a>. You can <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/2013-revenue-stats/">read my year in review here</a>.</p>
<h3>In 2014</h3>
<p>Another pivotal year. I left <a href="http://mailout.com">Mailout</a>, and created my own company, <a href="http://nerdnorth.com">Nerd North Inc</a> with my wife. I started doing product marketing consulting full-time. All of our kids were in school. This meant more freedom for side-projects. You can <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/2014-a-year-of-making-stuff/">read about all the details here</a>.</p>
<h3>In 2015</h3>
<p>I created a new podcast called <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net">Build &amp; Launch</a>. The premise of the show was that I would create a new product every week. The show did very well. <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/products/">I created a bunch of things</a>. This was also the year that I finally finished <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/marketingfordevelopers">Marketing for Developers</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, I decided to quit consulting and make the leap to &#8220;full-time product person.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2016</h3>
<p>This was the year I went independent. No employment income. No consulting income. My family and I would be fully reliant on product income.</p>
<p>I started the year by launching the <a href="http://megamaker.co/challenge">2016 Maker Challenge</a> and a new podcast called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/megamaker/id1074661788">MegaMaker</a>.</p>
<p>This new podcast is interesting, because it&#8217;s pushed me to go beyond the safe &#8220;digital&#8221; world into the real world. The first episodes 3-5 focused on creating a menu item, working in the kitchen all day, and then launching it as a Friday lunch special at <a href="http://stationbbq.com">Station BBQ</a> in Vernon, BC. The whole experience was humbling and gave me a <em>lot </em>of perspective: the restaurant / service industry is <em>hard.</em></p>
