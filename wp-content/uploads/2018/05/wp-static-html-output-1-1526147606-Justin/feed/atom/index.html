<h3>A story about unmet expectations</h3>
<p>In 2016, developers, video editors, and other pro users were eagerly awaiting Apple&#8217;s refresh of the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>However, when they got their hands on it, it was clear Apple had missed the mark.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Apple</a> Utterly dissapointed with the new macbook pro. The computer is way too expensive. New model removes USB, SD Card slot, magsafe. ????</p>
<p>— Ivy (@Ivan_Krazy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ivan_Krazy/status/795197765420650496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In all my years of using Apple products, I have never returned one. Until now. Last month I purchased the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. What a letdown. It&#8217;s the first Apple device that&#8217;s actually made me less productive. The company has lost touch with Steve Jobs&#8217; vision for simple, elegant machines.<span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">&#8221; – <a href="https://michaelhyatt.com/new-macbook-pro/">Michael Hyatt</a></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I&#8217;m actually thinking about returning my 2017 MacBook Pro and getting a used 2015. I&#8217;m not a 100% satisfied right now.</p>
<p>— Sniper (GER) (@Sniper_GER) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sniper_GER/status/925627468626714626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why did Apple lose touch with their customers?</h3>
<p>I think they just weren&#8217;t listening.</p>
<p>Leading up to the 2016 MacBook Pro reveal event, Sascha Segan, writing for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/348897/10-things-we-want-from-the-new-apple-macbook-pro">PC Magazine</a>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>To me, the most important aspect of the MacBook Pro is the &#8220;pro&#8221; part. This laptop should be a no-compromise workhorse for getting your business done on the road. I&#8217;ve been reading the rumors of what may be coming and going with some trepidation. Like many pro-level MacBook users, my biggest concern isn&#8217;t about what Apple is adding—it&#8217;s what might be taken away. I chose a Pro because it gives me the power, the ports, and the keyboard to get all of my work done.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Of course, there are many differing perspectives on Apple&#8217;s products.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">How could they know which voices to listen to, and which to ignore?</span></p>
<h3>People are complicated</h3>
<p>When you put anything out into the world, people will have opinions about it. And, to make things more confusing, everybody wants something different.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Why? People value different things depending on their context.</strong></p>
<p>With laptops, different groups want different features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Students </strong>want a laptop that is affordable, and lightweight (because they&#8217;ll be lugging it to class).</li>
<li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Programmers </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">want a laptop with a high-resolution screen, lots of memory, and a full-size keyboard.<br />
</span></li>
<li><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Gamers </strong>want a CPU and GPU with a lot of horsepower. They also don&#8217;t mind as much if the laptop is bulky.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Even these examples are too general because a person&#8217;s context has multiple dimensions. Some college students are wealthy. Many programmers are assigned computers by their employers and don&#8217;t have a say in what they get. Most gamers prefer a desktop machine because it&#8217;s easier to upgrade individual components.</p>
<p>So, you could ask a programmer &#8220;what&#8217;s your dream laptop?&#8221; and they might give you a truthful answer. But, if their boss is buying the computer, it might not matter what the programmer thinks. Unless the boss is a good boss, in which case the programmer&#8217;s opinion matters quite a bit.</p>
<p>Do you see how this can get complicated?</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Who you listen to </strong>matters quite a bit.</p>
<h3>Who you should listen to (and how you should listen)</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to give some very general advice, and some of you might disagree when you hear it:</p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">When it comes to product feedback, only listen to the people paying for your product. Explore <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">their</strong></em><em data-redactor-tag="em"> context; find out what&#8217;s important to <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">them</strong>.</em></p>
<p>I know some of you are screaming: &#8220;BUT SOME USERS DON&#8217;T PAY FOR THE PRODUCT AND THEIR VOICES ARE STILL IMPORTANT.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you. I too want to build products that benefit the actual users.</p>
<p>But, look at Facebook and Google. Many of us use them every day, but we don&#8217;t pay for them. Advertisers do. Facebook and Google don&#8217;t seem to care much about our privacy. They&#8217;ll track us, and share our information without our consent. Why? Their allegiance is with advertisers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a business serves whoever is paying them.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to our laptop example.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky is the founder of Fogcreek Software and has probably bought hundreds of laptops. If you were trying to sell him your computers, you&#8217;d want to read <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">his blog</a> and figure out what he values. In his case, he cares about treating developers well. He wants to give them autonomy. He&#8217;ll let them choose their machine and the tools they use.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ready to put this principle into action? Here are the steps I recommend:</p>
<h3>1. Serve a customer you care about</h3>
<p>You need founder/market fit with the people you&#8217;re serving; product/market fit isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t sell laptops to CTOs who don&#8217;t care about their developers! If you don&#8217;t respect the person paying you for your service,</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving a damn&#8221; about your customers is a substantial competitive advantage.</p>
<h3>2. Only take product feedback from people paying for your product</h3>
<p>The opinion of random people on Twitter&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t matter. Likewise, don&#8217;t listen to folks who keep saying they&#8217;ll buy your product, but never do. Their opinion doesn&#8217;t matter either.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Famously, Jason Fried said he only listens to feedback from customers who just bought or people who just canceled.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://danshipper.com/heres-what-i-learned-hanging-out-with-jason-fried">Dan Shipper</a> elaborates:</p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">A customer who just signed up can give good feedback for this reason: they&#8217;re only recently removed from the buying process. Because of this, it&#8217;s easier to get useful information about why they bought your product, what emotional event caused them to look for it and which part of it is actually useful for them.</em></p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">Similarly, a customer who just canceled can tell you exactly what you&#8217;re missing. They signed up and put their credit card information in because they thought you would be able to do a job for them. If they cancel, your product didn&#8217;t deliver what they expected.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t build features for people who aren&#8217;t paying you! Don&#8217;t try to please folks who haven&#8217;t proven that they&#8217;re willing to be your customer.</p>
<p>Are you a brand new startup with no customers? Jason advises that you talk to people who are paying for your <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">competitor&#8217;s</strong> product.</p>
<h3>3. Explore your customer&#8217;s context</h3>
<p>Get close to the customer, and observe how they&#8217;re using your product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those people who didn&#8217;t upgrade to the new MacBook Pros. Why? Here&#8217;s what my computer looks like most days:</p>

<p>If Apple had paid attention to how I, and many other pro customers, use their laptops every day, maybe they would have thought differently about what they offered in the new MacBook Pros.</p>
<h3>4. Listen to your customers</h3>
<p>Beyond observing your customers, you should also do customer interviews. Ask customers questions: What are they struggling with? In what ways do they want their lives to be better?</p>
<p>Going back to the MacBook Pro example, we saw many Apple customers stating: &#8220;This is what I wanted, and I&#8217;m disappointed by what I got.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users wanted more memory, more power, and a full-size keyboard (&#8220;Don&#8217;t take away my ESC key!&#8221;). Many folks wanted that SD card slot and more ports. But what they got was a thinner, lighter machine with a touch bar. That&#8217;s why there was so much disappointment.</p>
<p>The new offering didn&#8217;t feel like a step forward. It felt like a step back.</p>
<p>For years, Apple produced a MacBook Pro that users loved. But, in this case, they got it wrong.</p>
<p>Their example shows how difficult product/market fit is.</p>
<p>As entrepreneurs, we need to listen to our customers. What do they care about now? What do they want now?</p>
<p>Customers are a moving target; their context and desires are continually evolving. Our job is to listen.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/new-saas/"><![CDATA[<p>Back in the Spring of 2015, I was chatting with Nathan Barry.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d recently decided to leave his info-product business behind, and double-down on his SaaS (ConvertKit).</p>
<p>At the time, the decision seemed ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>I was working as a Product Manager for Sprintly but had just published <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>. I was eagerly anticipating a time where I&#8217;d be able to quit my job and go independent.</p>
<p>To me, Nathan was living the dream. The year previously he&#8217;d done nearly $300,000 in revenue from books and courses.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1783" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/new-saas/nathan-barry-net-income/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?fit=540%2C358&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="540,358" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Nathan Barry net income" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?fit=500%2C331&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?fit=540%2C358&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1783" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?resize=540%2C358&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nathan Barry net income" width="540" height="358" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png?resize=500%2C331&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As someone who was looking on longingly from the sidelines, I couldn&#8217;t imagine leaving that kind of business behind.</p>
<p>When I asked him about it, he replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a bunch of reasons I decided to focus on ConvertKit. First, I needed a challenge. Second, <strong>I know people that have gotten to half a million or a couple million dollars a year in revenue off books and courses. And when I look at their business models, I just don’t like it.</strong> To get to $1 million in revenue you have to optimize just about everything. It’s diminishing returns; it’s like squeezing blood from a stone. To drive more revenue, you have to do more launches, and hire more people. Folks that are winning at info-products have huge monthly expenses and lower profit margins. With SaaS, I saw a substantial business I could grow for a long time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I shook my head. It still seemed crazy to me. In 2014, ConvertKit had done about $39,000 in revenue (almost 8x less than his books). I just didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<h3>Fast forward two years</h3>
<p>I followed Nathan&#8217;s playbook, and went independent in 2016, using <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a> and <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> as my platform. In 2017 I added <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> to my product mix.</p>
<p>Revenue-wise, my little solo business did pretty well:</p>

<p>But something else happened in my second year of business. Something I didn&#8217;t expect. I got depressed. For the first time in my life, I was dealing with intense mental health issues. There were weeks where I was only able to work five hours total.</p>
<p>There was a huge downside to solopreneurship that I hadn&#8217;t considered: when you get sick, there&#8217;s nobody else around to keep your business running. Most of my marketing, video tutorials, and coaching require me to be charismatic and energetic; there were many days where I just couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>When the year ended, I was mentally and financially drained.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to therapy, I&#8217;m feeling a lot better now. But the experience moved me.</p>
<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>The past two years have taught me some valuable lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&#8217;ve worked too hard, and haven&#8217;t left enough margin in my life.</strong> Brennan Dunn warned me about this in a private conversation at MicroConf. I&#8217;ve been doing too much of the work myself, and haven&#8217;t leveraged automation when I should have.</li>
<li><strong>The info-products business is hard to scale.</strong> Doing courses, workshops, and books have helped me earn an independent income. I plan to continue doing it while we&#8217;re building this new SaaS. But, like Nathan mentioned, scaling it is difficult. You&#8217;re either on a never-ending hamster wheel of launches, or, you&#8217;re investing in employees, sophisticated automation, and non-stop webinars.</li>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m ready to partner up. </strong>I&#8217;ve always liked working alone. But my health scare this past year changed me. The advantage of having a partner, is you&#8217;ve got someone to lean on when times get tough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The announcement: I&#8217;m building a new podcasting SaaS</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a>. It was started by my friend Jon Buda, in Chicago. I&#8217;m coming on as his co-founder.</p>
<p>Jon and I were introduced in 2014 by our mutual friend Chase Reeves at XOXO in Portland. Here&#8217;s a photo from the day we met:</p>

<p>At the time, I was writing Marketing for Devs. Jon was working on a podcasting app with someone else. He invited me to host my podcast with him.</p>
<p>Before we left, we said: &#8220;Let&#8217;s build something together someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jon&#8217;s first partnership didn&#8217;t work out. He eventually got a job doing full-stack web dev in Chicago. We kept in touch and met up again in 2015.</p>
<p>In June 2016, we tried building a community platform. Ultimately, we decided not to move forward with the idea, but it gave us a chance to work together.</p>
<p>Finally, in December 2017, Jon told me about a new podcasting project he&#8217;d started: <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor</a>. He was getting tired of working on it by himself. I was tired of working solo too. So we started talking about partnering up.</p>
<p>We finished signing all the legal documents last week. We&#8217;re now official co-founders!</p>
<h3>What is Transistor.fm? How does it compare to other podcasting hosting apps?</h3>
<p>Businesses like Basecamp, eBay, and Code Pen have discovered the power of having a branded podcast. Instead of running ads on someone else&#8217;s show, they&#8217;re investing in building their own audience.</p>
<p><strong>We want to make Transistor the best way to create a podcast for your business.</strong></p>
<p>We already have users!</p>

<p>Cards Against Humanity was our first paying customer. Their show, <a href="http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">The Good News Podcast</a>, is hosted on Transistor.</p>
<p>Since launching the beta in December, we&#8217;re hosting a handful of shows, and have already served 2 million podcast downloads.</p>
<p>We aim to help companies overcome the challenges of making a podcast. We want to help them create compelling content, build a podcast website, format their feed correctly, find listeners, and get a good return on their investment.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p><span class=" author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z9z84zhz69z8n1jz81zz69zz70zz90zz67zsz78zz68zrz81zz122zz81zcz89zz122zmz89zw2z73zz81zz66zz90z">Jon and I have lots of plans for Transistor</span>. This will be a side-project for both of us in 2018. He&#8217;ll continue to work full-time, and I&#8217;ll continue to sell <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com">my products</a>, and do <a href="https://megamaker.co/coaching">coaching</a> to pay the bills.</p>
<p>One thing that excites me, especially for <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/motivation/">Tiny Wins</a> customers, is that I&#8217;ll be able to use Transistor as a live case study for my tutorials. Everything I&#8217;m learning and applying on my SaaS, I&#8217;ll be sharing.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along with Transistor, subscribe to <a href="https://saas.transistor.fm/">our podcast</a>, follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/transistorfm">on Twitter</a>, or sign-up for our <a href="https://transistor.fm/">waiting list</a>.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/motivation/"><![CDATA[<p>Typically, when I&#8217;m at Safeway, you&#8217;ll find me in the cereal aisle, checking to see if Cheerios are on sale. I have four kids, and cereal is pretty expensive, so I almost always buy what&#8217;s on sale.</p>
<p>If I get to the checkout and I&#8217;ve saved $5, I feel like I&#8217;ve succeeded.</p>
<p>But today was different.</p>
<p>It was the night before Valentine&#8217;s Day, and like twenty other men, I was in the floral section looking for the perfect bouquet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a special trip. I&#8217;m walking around with intensity. It&#8217;s crowded; I&#8217;m jostling for position as other men scurry around. I&#8217;m not looking at price tags, but rather which arrangements &#8220;feel&#8221; right. I&#8217;m <strong>highly motivated</strong> to find the right flowers for someone I love.</p>
<p>Buying flowers is a lot different than buying Cheerios.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different is the <strong>emotion</strong> behind the purchase. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, price is no object. Lovers will spend significant amounts on flowers, dinner, and gifts. Why? They&#8217;re motivated to show affection to their partner.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredible how motivation can change behavior. Even a price-conscious customer will jump over hurdles, bypass objections, and get to the sale faster when they&#8217;re motivated.</p>
<h3>How motivated is your customer?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling Cheerios, and they&#8217;re not on sale, maybe I&#8217;ll buy oatmeal instead.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re selling the last seats to a Valentine&#8217;s Day Symphony, and my spouse wants to go, you better believe I&#8217;m motivated to get those tickets (and pay whatever it takes).</p>
<p>This principle also applies to selling software. I see many developers selling apps to unmotivated customers. If you&#8217;re tugging, pulling, and begging people to try your product, you have a motivation problem.</p>
<p>The smartest founders look for people already in motion, who are highly motivated to find a solution for an obstacle in their life.</p>
<h3>A story: Stripe</h3>
<p>Getting a merchant account used to be hard. You would have to fill out lengthy forms, fax them in, get background checks, and pay high applications fees. The crazy thing? People were doing it! That&#8217;s how motivated they were to accept payments online.</p>
<p>The Collison brothers noticed this and formed <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. They targeted a highly motivated group and made it easier for them to get what they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I really want to get this store online. Oh, damn, I need to fill out this 40-page document, and wait six weeks to get a merchant account?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Now:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I really want to get this store online. Oh sweet! All I need to do is sign up for Stripe, and 30 seconds later, I&#8217;m accepting credit cards!</p></blockquote>
<p>The customer is still highly motivated, but Stripe has just made it easier for them to make progress.</p>
<h3>What affects customer motivation?</h3>
<p>Here are a few factors to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Societal context: </strong>YouTube beat iFilm, even though iFilm was first. The problem? iFilm launched in 1997 when most consumers were still using dial-up (the 56k modem came out in &#8217;97). YouTube started in 2005, right when broadband was exploding. Over the next year, high-speed internet grew 40% in North America. The time was right for online video.</li>
<li><strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Personal context: </strong>As we go through different phases of life, our motivation changes. <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/principlesmarketing/chapter/3-1-factors-that-influence-consumers-buying-behavior/">In this textbook</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, the authors observe that &#8220;w</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">hen you were a child, the last thing you probably wanted as a gift was clothing. As you became a teen, however, cool clothes probably became a bigger priority.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><strong>Reference groups:</strong> If all your peers are on Snapchat, you&#8217;ll be more motivated to be there too. And, if everyone leaves for Instagram, you&#8217;ll likely follow. We tend to mirror the people we identify with. It&#8217;s also true in business: notice how many startups moved their blogs to Medium, or have started using live chat on their homepage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Timing is crucial. You don&#8217;t want to offer a product too early, and you don&#8217;t want to be too late. It&#8217;s usually best to be a bit ahead of the curve.</p>
<h3>How to find motivated customers</h3>
<p>Look for people in motion!</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they searching for answers on Google?</li>
<li>Are they asking for recommendations in Slack?</li>
<li>Are they sharing hacks and workarounds in private groups?</li>
<li>Are they hiring contractors and employees to get the task done?</li>
<li>Are they willing to jump through hoops, just to make the progress they desire?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t waste your time trying to convince unmotivated customers.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on folks who have a strong inward urge to get what they want.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/"><![CDATA[<p>It was 10pm on a Friday night. I was sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop open.</p>
<p>I was watching hundreds of Stripe payment notifications come through:</p>

<p>Thousands of dollars were pouring into my account.</p>
<p>And I was miserable.</p>
<p>A year previous, I&#8217;d launched a new subscription product called <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>.</p>
<p>People loved it. I&#8217;d received tons of <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/reviews/">good reviews</a>.</p>
<p>But now it was renewal time. And I started getting emails:</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to circumstances, I wasn&#8217;t able to take full advantage of TMW last year. This year, I have laid out plans to go from working &#8220;in&#8221; my business to actually changing things around and making progress. But I haven&#8217;t finished last year&#8217;s courses. Do I really need to pay again?</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Also common:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry, Justin, I had forgotten this was a yearly subscription. I&#8217;m happy with the current version, but I&#8217;m only 50% finished. Could you refund this second payment?</p></blockquote>
<p>As more emails came in, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach: &#8220;this isn&#8217;t working.&#8221;</p>
<h3>What went wrong?</h3>
<p>Tiny Wins started as a free 14-day drip email sequence. Every day, I&#8217;d send you a new marketing tip.</p>

<p>It launched on Product Hunt on Oct 29, 2015. Nearly four thousand people signed up.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>After the 14 days was over, people asked me if I was going to keep doing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way I&#8217;d be able to keep doing it is if it was a paid subscription,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We&#8217;ll pay!&#8221; my subscribers said.</strong></p>
<p>I sat on the idea for awhile but finally launched a paid subscription in February 2017.</p>
<p>True to form, hundreds of people paid $249 for a year&#8217;s subscription.</p>
<p>I started sending them weekly marketing tutorial (video + pdf), and they tracked their progress inside the app:</p>

<h3>User feedback + iteration</h3>
<p>In the first few months, I noticed that people were completing the tactics much slower than I&#8217;d anticipated:</p>

<p>I started talking to my users and doing surveys. The results proved my suspicion:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1766" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/initial-tweet/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?fit=475%2C267&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="475,267" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Survey results: &#8220;show me how to create a Facebook ad,&#8221; &#8220;help me implement basic SEO,&#8221; &#8220;train me on Google Analytics&#8221;" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?fit=475%2C267&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?fit=475%2C267&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1766" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/initial-tweet.png?resize=475%2C267&#038;ssl=1" alt="Survey results: &quot;show me how to create a Facebook ad,&quot; &quot;help me implement basic SEO,&quot; &quot;train me on Google Analytics&quot;" width="475" height="267" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>So, I tweaked the product to be focused on functional categories. I improved the dashboard as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/tactics/"><img data-attachment-id="1767" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?fit=2660%2C1482&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2660,1482" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Tiny Marketing Wins dashboard shows you your progress" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?fit=500%2C279&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?fit=600%2C335&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1767" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?resize=600%2C335&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tiny Marketing Wins dashboard shows you your progress" width="600" height="335" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?resize=1024%2C571&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?resize=500%2C279&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?resize=768%2C428&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The feedback from users was good:</p>

<p>People liked the new format. It also helped me (as the creator) think about specific outcomes my users needed, and respond to those directly.</p>
<p>But that still left a big question&#8230;</p>
<h3>What about the business model?</h3>
<p>The original idea with Tiny Wins is that I&#8217;d send users a new marketing tactic every seven days. That meant recording a new video tutorial and creating the handbook PDF, every week.</p>
<p>As 2017 came to an end, I took another look at individual completion rates:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1765" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?fit=1162%2C337&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1162,337" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="WPComplete showed me course completion rates inside of WordPress" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?fit=500%2C145&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?fit=600%2C174&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1765" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?resize=600%2C174&#038;ssl=1" alt="WPComplete showed me course completion rates inside of WordPress" width="600" height="174" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?resize=1024%2C297&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?resize=500%2C145&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?resize=768%2C223&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete.png?w=1162&amp;ssl=1 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In retrospect, this makes sense. What solopreneur has time to implement a new marketing tactic every week?</p>
<p>As I was pondering all of this, the annual renewals I was referring to earlier started coming through.</p>
<p>My stomach started to sink.</p>
<p>Once I started receiving refund requests, I knew: this wasn&#8217;t going to work as a subscription service.</p>
<p>I had to make a decision.</p>
<p>So, that Friday night, I manually refunded hundreds of payments. <strong>In total, I refunded about $30,000.</strong></p>
<p>I emailed users to tell them I was canceling all annual renewals. They&#8217;d still be able to access the content, and I was going to think about my next steps.</p>
<h3>Right product, wrong business model</h3>
<p>Sending that email, and refunding all those charges, was one of the hardest things I had to do.</p>
<p>But, I started hearing from customers right away:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1770" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/cancel-encouragement/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?fit=696%2C266&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="696,266" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="A cancelled user sends encouragement" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?fit=500%2C191&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?fit=600%2C229&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?resize=600%2C229&#038;ssl=1" alt="A cancelled user sends encouragement" width="600" height="229" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?w=696&amp;ssl=1 696w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png?resize=500%2C191&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Customers liked the product; they didn&#8217;t like the business model.</p>
<p>I wrote about this threat <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/saas/">back in 2016</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many founders choose SaaS just because you want the recurring revenue. But just because you like the model as a founder, doesn’t mean it’s the right model for your customers, your product, your niche, or the current market conditions!</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, my customers were used to paying <strong>once</strong> for online courses. But here, they had to pay annually, and once their plan expired, they no longer had access.</p>
<h3>Pivoting to lifetime access</h3>
<p>After listening to customer feedback, I decided to try a new business model:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Tiny Marketing Wins is an awesome list of marketing tutorials. And now, you pay once for lifetime access.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I sent out the announcement email. Here&#8217;s what I heard back:</p>

<p>Already, 102 people have registered for <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/register/">lifetime access</a>.</p>
<p>It cost me $30,000 in refunds, but I feel like I may have cracked product-market fit. My plan now is to slowly add new tactics (probably 1-2 a month) to the list.</p>
<p>Currently, folks have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can buy my Tiny Wins courses <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/">individually</a> (currently $600+ in total)</li>
<li>They can get lifetime access to Tiny Wins for under $300.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">check out the new Tiny Marketing Wins here</a>. Until Feb 28, 2018, get $50 off lifetime access with the code <code>relaunch</code>.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>For promoters, there was quite a bit of risk in putting on an event. The upside could mean thousands of dollars in profit, but if no one showed up, you would be on the hook for all the expenses (sound system, DJ flights, and venue costs).<span class="redactor-invisible-space">?</span></p>
<h3>In grade 12, I put on a rave in my hometown</h3>
<p>My buddy, Adrian, and I wanted to bring that big-city rave experience to our little town of 7,000 people.</p>
<p>It was 1998, and I was 17 years old. By some miracle, I still have the Word and Excel files we used to plan the event. Our budget was $1,232.48:<span class="redactor-invisible-space">?</span></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1758" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/raves/1998-rave-budget/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?fit=1610%2C586&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1610,586" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1998-rave-budget" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?fit=500%2C182&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?fit=600%2C219&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1758" src="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?resize=600%2C219&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="219" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?resize=1024%2C373&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?resize=500%2C182&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?resize=768%2C280&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1998-rave-budget.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We knew if we sold 200 tickets, at $8 each, we&#8217;d be fine. But we wanted to minimize our risk.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what we did:</p>
<ul>
<li>We printed posters, flyers, and 200 tickets. Total cost: $60.</li>
<li>We &#8220;hired&#8221; tickets reps in both of the local high schools.</li>
<li>They were each given 20 tickets and a bunch of flyers. If they sold all 20 tickets, they got to come to the event for free.<span class="redactor-invisible-space">?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a good laugh, check out <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ticket-Representative-Info.pdf">Ticket_Representative_Info.PDF</a>. I can&#8217;t believe I was this detailed! ?</p>
<p>Listen to me coaching our teenaged sales reps:<span class="redactor-invisible-space">?</span></p>
<p><em data-redactor-tag="em">Be enthusiastic! If you sound excited about the event people will be more likely to come. Be outgoing, make it sound like they&#8217;re missing out on the biggest party of the year. Try to paint a mental picture for them (huge lights! huge sound! lots of girls!).</em></p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">It worked.</strong></p>
<p>Within a few weeks, we sold all 200 advanced tickets.</p>
<h3>What we learned about sales and marketing</h3>
<p>For our rave, Adrian and I minimized our risk by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing posters and flyers to build anticipation.</li>
<li>Getting influencers in the high schools to spread the word.</li>
<li>Pre-selling 200 tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s no greater asset than a list of people who are signed up and waiting for you to open the doors.</p>
<p>The night of the dance, hundreds of people crowded outside. Even though we still had to deliver a great experience, we knew we&#8217;d cleared the hardest hurdle: getting people interested in our thing.</p>
<h3>How does this relate to your startup idea?</h3>
<p>Before you invest a bunch of time and money building something, minimize your risk by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a landing page to build anticipation.</li>
<li>Finding distribution channels (influencers, social, SEO) to get traffic for your landing page.</li>
<li>Having a waiting list (or even pre-selling your product).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there&#8217;s no greater feeling than a list of people who are signed up and waiting for you to open the doors.</p>
<p>Minimize your risk! <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/build-better-landing-pages">Create your landing page</a> <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">before</strong> you start coding.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://justinjackson.ca/grade9/"><![CDATA[<p>When he appeared on screen, I was surprised. Usually, folks who <a href="https://megamaker.co/book-coaching-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire me</a> are in their 30s, 40s, or 50s.</p>
<p>But Clint was young, in his early 20s. He had youthful excitement in his eyes and a big smile on his face.</p>
<p>He wanted to discuss his product idea. It involved the blockchain and a bunch of other tech I didn&#8217;t understand. But that was OK because Clint wanted my advice on marketing. He wondered, how could they promote this complicated tech to investors who might be 60 to 70 years old?</p>
<h3>Let me see your landing page&#8230;</h3>
<p>Invariably, my first question for a new startup is: do you have a landing page?</p>
<p>Initially, Clint was skeptical.</p>
<p>I asked him to imagine himself in this scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pretend I&#8217;m a 65-year-old investor. You manage to get a coffee meeting with me. We sit down at a table with our mugs, and I ask you: &#8220;Ok, what&#8217;s this investment opportunity you have for me?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Clint started back at me blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead Clint,&#8221; I prodded, &#8220;sell me on your product!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, right now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup, go for it!&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He then did what most of us do when someone asks us: &#8220;So what are you working on?&#8221; In a halting voice, he meandered through a 5-minute description of the tech, and how it worked. <strong>He was passionate about the topic, but couldn&#8217;t articulate his product&#8217;s value.</strong></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>&#8220;This is why you need a landing page,&#8221; I answered.</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Writing a landing page helps you clarify:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who</strong> your product is for.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> their main struggle is.</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> you help them overcome that struggle.</li>
<li><strong>How </strong>their life will be better.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit of doing this work goes beyond having a sales page on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ll have a description of your product that you (and your team) can use <strong>everywhere</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you get on an elevator, and someone asks about your app.</li>
<li>At a conference, when folks inquire: &#8220;What do you do for work?&#8221;</li>
<li>In your emails, blog posts, podcasts, tweets, and YouTube videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a reusable soundbite that communicates your product&#8217;s value.</p>
<p><strong>The other benefit?</strong></p>
<p>After you describe your product, you can point folks to your <strong>landing page </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space">and get them to sign up.</span></p>
<h3>A plot twist</h3>
<p>I was enjoying my call with Clint. He was energetic, writing notes, and engaging with the process. I ended up giving him extra time.</p>
<p>I was about to end the call when he interrupted me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Justin, I need to tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to tell you that I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of yours since I was in the <strong>ninth grade</strong>. I discovered your <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Is A Web Page</a>, and I&#8217;ve been on your newsletter list ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did some quick mental math. I published that page on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5913381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 20, 2013</a>. Five years ago. That means Clint had been following my work since he was 14 or 15 years old.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great reminder about the power of words, and the legacy our web pages can create.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>I usually focus on business in these reviews (you can read <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/2016-review/">2016</a>, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/2015-in-review/">2015</a>, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/2014-a-year-of-making-stuff/">2014</a>, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/2013-revenue-stats/">2013</a> here).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing a different year-in-review this year. I&#8217;m grateful for 2017, even though personally it was my most difficult. I&#8217;m going to start with two new categories: what I learned, and what I&#8217;m thankful for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, read on!</p>
<h2>What I learned in 2017</h2>
<h3>Business isn&#8217;t the most important thing in life.</h3>
<p>Ultimately, my most significant accomplishments won&#8217;t be &#8220;increasing my conversion by 10%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Owning your own business can make your life better. But it&#8217;s more of a sideshow. It&#8217;s not the main event.</p>

<p>Genuine human connection, quality relationships, meaningful experiences: these should be the pillars of our lives. We can pursue these, now, no matter what stage we&#8217;re at with our business.</p>
<h3>Every technology has downsides</h3>
<p>Before my family moved to BC, I got rid of all of my physical books. &#8220;I&#8217;m going digital!&#8221; I proclaimed.</p>
<p>The original plan is that I&#8217;d use my iPad Mini to read Kindle books.</p>
<p>Then my kids took the iPad, so I started reading on my iPhone.</p>
<p>This year, my youngest son was having trouble with reading at school. And I had this sudden realization:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;My kids never see me reading a physical book.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>To them, I&#8217;m always looking at my phone.</p>
<p>Getting rid of my physical books had another negative consequence. When my kids got bored, they can&#8217;t go and explore my bookshelf. Growing up, I&#8217;d always be looking at our family&#8217;s library for something to read. My parents&#8217; books exposed me to new ideas and authors I wouldn&#8217;t have found on my own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been quick to point out the upsides to technology, but rarely do I stop and think about the downsides.</p>
<p>Technology can have adverse sociological, psychological, and environmental effects.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Technology always has a flip side.</p>
<p>There are benefits (convenience, speed, connectivity, creative empowerment)</p>
<p>But we don’t always see the negatives: loss of jobs, tech addiction, human isolation, consolidation of power&#8230;</p>

<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers, and what we could make with them. Since I started using the internet in the early 90s, I&#8217;ve been eager to participate in it and encourage its growth.</p>
<p>But all of this connectivity has pitfalls. As a society, it&#8217;s something we need to consider. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll be thinking about a lot in 2018.</p>
<h3>Your mental and physical health is your most important asset</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re not healthy, you can&#8217;t achieve anything worthwhile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent too much of my life seeing how &#8220;close to the metal&#8221; I can push myself.</p>
<p>I was reminded multiple times this year about the importance of having margin in your life. Give yourself a buffer! Don&#8217;t overexert yourself. Eat well, sleep well, exercise, and most importantly, get a therapist.</p>
<h3>Get a therapist</h3>
<p>For the first time this year, I started seeing a therapist regularly. In the past, I told myself I didn&#8217;t need therapy. It felt like it was too expensive, that I couldn&#8217;t find the time, that it would be too hard to find someone I could trust.</p>
<p>But this year a bunch of personal issues collided, and the result was anguish like I&#8217;ve never felt. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, and into my counsellor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Now, in retrospect, I wish I&#8217;d found a therapist years ago. Counselling, without question, has saved my life this year.</p>
<p>There is no substitute for speaking to a professionally trained counselor. They will listen to you better than your friends can and give you the right tools for you and your situation. Don&#8217;t rely on the internet. Don&#8217;t try to solve all your problems yourself. And don&#8217;t put it off.</p>
<p>My friend Sherry Walling has a <a href="https://zenfounder.com/episodes/episode-94-why-you-might-want-to-find-a-therapist/">great guide on finding a therapist here</a>.</p>
<h2>What I&#8217;m thankful for</h2>
<h3>Revenue grew by 23%</h3>
<p>2016 was my first year as a solo product entrepreneur. That year I did $146,000.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1749" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/2017-review/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue.png?fit=600%2C371&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,371" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2017 product income for Justin Jackson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue.png?fit=500%2C309&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue.png?fit=600%2C371&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1749" src="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue.png?resize=600%2C371&#038;ssl=1" alt="2017 product income for Justin Jackson" width="600" height="371" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-jackson-2017-product-income-revenue.png?resize=500%2C309&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Like I mentioned, 2017 was challenging. There were many days where I was only able to get one hour of work done. However, business revenue still increased to $190,000.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the only employee and took home about $120,000 (before tax) in salary and owner draws. The fact that I can do this work, and support my family of six, is still incredible to me.</p>
<p>By my calculation, <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/">my store</a> made 2,513 sales last year. That&#8217;s thousands of people buying something I made. I&#8217;m so thankful for every one of them. Their encouragement these past few years has been invaluable.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rough revenue breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Devs</a>: $75,000</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://megamaker.co/club/">MegaMaker Club</a>: $54,000</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/tinywins">Tiny Wins</a>: $44,000</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/jolt">Jolt</a>: $1,300</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discomfort and pain</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent most of my life trying to avoid discomfort.</p>
<p>2017 was the hardest year I&#8217;ve ever faced. I&#8217;ve had to reckon with personal issues that I&#8217;ve been hiding from for years. That&#8217;s meant confronting a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Experiencing all of this at once had a significant impact on my life, but it hasn&#8217;t all been negative.</p>
<p>If it hadn&#8217;t gotten this bad, I would have never reached out for help. I wouldn&#8217;t have started therapy. I would have kept running away from my problems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m learning to face the discomfort.</p>
<h3>Scotland</h3>
<p>In June, my family and I had an incredible adventure in Scotland. My wife and I have four kids, so this was a big one.</p>
<p>In the past, making a big international trip from Canada felt out of reach. But, we were able to get a crazy deal on flights to Glasgow, so we decided to go for 17 days and explore the whole country.</p>
<p>We hiked, climbed, and swam in the ocean at the Isle of Skye. We drove around the country in an RV. We toured castles, museums, and restaurants in Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>

<p>It was awesome. We made memories we&#8217;ll remember forever.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Justin, you think you&#8217;re motivated primarily by creativity, but you&#8217;re playing to your second strength. Your primary motivation is relationships.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More and more, I think he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>A lot of my past five years, I tried to hide away in my creative cave and make things. Making things is enjoyable for me.</p>
<p>But when I think back on this past year, my highlights aren&#8217;t from anything I&#8217;ve made. It&#8217;s all about the people I met.</p>
<p>For example, on our trip to Scotland, I loved the experiences we had, but my favorite part was meeting up with people I knew from the internet.</p>

<p>I also went on two retreats that had a massive impact on me.</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc, Sean McCabe, and James Clear invited me to their annual retreat. I joined 12 other men in Breckenridge, Colorado. The conversations we had about life and business were profoundly impactful.</p>

<p>I also traveled to Victoria to meet up with Paul Jarvis and Jarrod Drysdale for the first time. We&#8217;ve been online friends for years, and call each other every week. It was incredible to spend time with them in real life and make plans for the coming year.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer, my friend Mike Vardy and I took our kids to the waterpark and amusement park together.</p>

<h2>Plans for 2018</h2>
<h3>I&#8217;m building a SaaS</h3>
<p>The past year, I&#8217;ve made most of my income from training people how to do product development and marketing. My three biggest products by revenue are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz/">Marketing for Developers</a> – a book and course for programmers who want to learn how to launch and promote a product.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://megamaker.co/club/">MegaMaker Club</a> – an online community for indie product people.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/tinywins">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> – growth tactics and training for software companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of what I teach was learned in the trenches while I was Product Manager at Sprintly and Mailout.</p>
<p>I want to practice what I preach. It&#8217;s time for a new challenge: to launch a profitable SaaS in 2018. The benefit for my customers is I&#8217;ll be sharing the new things I&#8217;m learning with them in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve got something in the works. Stay tuned for details!</strong></p>
<p>My courses and books will still be my primary source of income in the coming years. But, I&#8217;m excited to get back in the trenches, so I have more to teach!</p>
<h3>Tiny Marketing Wins</h3>
<p>Tiny Wins had a successful launch last February (my biggest ever). I still feel it has enormous potential. In 2018, Tiny Wins is the product I&#8217;ll be updating the most.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought people would want a general marketing tip each week. That turned out to be wrong. Instead, many folks have things they want to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How do I create a Facebook Ad?&#8221;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to implement some basic SEO tactics on our website.&#8221;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I need to train our new hire on Google Analytics.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>So I&#8217;ve completely reorganized Tiny Wins around mini-courses. You can buy them individually ($39 &#8211; $99) in <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/">my store</a>, or you can get access to all of them with a <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/tinywins">subscription</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also hoping to launch the &#8220;done for you&#8221; service this year. If you don&#8217;t have time to implement a tactic yourself, my team of contractors will do it for you!</p>
<h3>MegaMaker</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve consolidated all my business stuff under the &#8220;MegaMaker&#8221; umbrella. If you want product and marketing advice, go to <a href="https://megamaker.co">megamaker.co</a>. This site (justinjackson.ca) is going to be shifting to more personal topics.</p>
<h3>Speaking</h3>
<p>I love giving talks. Last year I spoke at MicroConf in Las Vegas (Thanks Mike and Rob!), and at Laracon in New York City (thanks Taylor!).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1716" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/microconf/microconf2017-less03/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1920,1080" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="MicroConf 2018 tips for attendees by Justin Jackson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?fit=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1716" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?resize=600%2C338&#038;ssl=1" alt="MicroConf 2018 tips for attendees by Justin Jackson" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?resize=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microconf2017-less03.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;m already booked to be a speaker (AND THE MC) at <a href="http://www.microconf.com/starter/">MicroConf Starter</a> (May 1-3).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/speaking/">book me to speak here</a>.</p>
<h2>Thank you.</h2>
<p>While I&#8217;m more wary of technology these days, I still strongly believe in this sentiment from <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">Words</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You and I have been able to connect because of the web. Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect here.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m so grateful for all the incredible human beings I&#8217;ve been able to meet through web pages, tweets, and podcasts.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a part of my story, and allowing me to be a part of yours.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Justin Jackson<br />

<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing the &#8220;December blues,&#8221; you&#8217;re not alone! The end of the year is demanding for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re reflective.</strong> You&#8217;re reviewing the good and the bad from 2017.</li>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re thinking about 2018. </strong>The new year is just weeks away, and you&#8217;re already making plans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus: <strong>December is busy</strong>. Personally, you&#8217;re shopping, and going to holiday events. Professionally, you&#8217;ve got tons of work to do!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder we&#8217;re overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>How to finish the year strong</h3>
<p><strong>You have about 8 work days left before Christmas day.</strong> That&#8217;s enough time for one last sprint before the new year.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a plan that&#8217;s worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose one project to finish.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to complete everything before 2018. Look at your project list, and pick one thing you can <em>reasonably </em>complete. Remember, 8 days isn&#8217;t a lot of time!</li>
<li><strong>Write a mini year-in-review</strong>. Take out a notepad, and write: &#8220;What are three things I&#8217;m thankful for this year?&#8221; In bullet form, list three things. Under that, ask yourself: &#8220;What are three things I&#8217;d like to improve next year?&#8221; Write out a few ideas for 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Do one thing to prepare for 2018.</strong> Now is a good time to connect with your coach, or your accountability group, and share your year-in-review. Let them suggest some practical steps you can take in January.</li>
</ol>
<p>This framework has helped me to be <strong>realistic </strong>about what I can finish. It also allows me to be <strong>reflective </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space">without being overwhelmed. And finally, it enables me to <strong>prepare </strong>for the new year</span>, with a list of things I can start doing on January 2nd.</p>
<p>The best part? <strong>It&#8217;s helped me to <em>enjoy </em>the holidays! </strong>Instead of feeling guilty about not getting enough work done, or being stressed about the new year, I can relax.</p>
<p><strong>You need to relax too!</strong></p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s take the next week to <em>work hard</em>, <em>reflect</em>, and <em>prepare</em>.</p>
<p>And after that&#8230; sit down with a hot drink and enjoy the warmth of the season.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />

Now my vision is much clearer. I&#8217;m ready for my next steps!<span class="redactor-invisible-space">&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Darian is a designer living in Mt Vernon, Washington. He had the same challenges as me: a day job that took most of his time, and a new baby at home. But his dream was to build an audience and become an independent maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">So what did he do? <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">He started small</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">He looked on his hard drive, and found two design assets he&#8217;d used for other projects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buy.compassofdesign.com/topographic-vectors-and-images">Topographic map vectors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buy.compassofdesign.com/hi-resolution-dry-brushed-ink-textures">A collection of Photoshop ink brushes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He decided to put them up for sale on <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>, at $10 each.</p>
<p>To promote it, he posted it on <a href="https://compassofdesign.com/">his website</a>. He also told friends in a Slack group about it, and posted a few tweets.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">What happened?</strong></p>
<p>He earned his first dollars on the internet!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Getting those first sales was enough for me to believe that I can actually make something people are willing to pay money for. I was fairly unknown in the design space too, so it was surprising.&#8221; – <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Here&#8217;s what he learned:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised how many things you make in in client work that could be turned into a product. Even old pieces from other designs that are just lying around on my desktop or client folders.&#8221; – <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key is to <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">just get started</strong>. Doing <em data-redactor-tag="em">something</em> is better than sitting in your car and doing <em data-redactor-tag="em">nothing</em><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">. Now that Darian&#8217;s launched his first products, he&#8217;s closer to his goal of quitting his day job. It might take 2-3 more years of working at it, but that&#8217;s better than waiting forever!</span></p>
<h3>What should you do?</h3>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">1. Look through your hard drive</strong></p>
<p>You might already have assets that you could turn into a small product! Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">An Excel sheet that you use to calculate cash flow</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">A PDF checklist you use before you launch a new project</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Photographs that could be used as stock images</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Music you&#8217;ve composed that someone could use on their podcast</span></li>
<li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Old sketches you made for a client, but they never used</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">2. Turn those assets into a sellable product</strong></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to take the item you&#8217;d like to sell and put some polish on it!</p>
<p>For Darian, this meant cleaning up his illustrations, and creating the .ai, .svg, .png, .jpg files.</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">3. Get a digital storefront</strong></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">I recommend using <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>. They&#8217;ll give you a product page, host your files, and handle the checkout and delivery process.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Upload your files, upload a header image, and set a price!</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">4. Promote your product</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">To make sales, you&#8217;ll need to get the word out. Here are a few channels to try:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Online communities, Slack chats, Facebook Groups, and forums</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designernews.co/badges/show">&#8220;Show DN&#8221;</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/show">&#8220;Show HN&#8221;</a>, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a></li>
<li>Your mailing list or Twitter audience</li>
<li>Your friend&#8217;s mailing list, or Twitter audience</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get to this stage, please reply to this email and let me know! I&#8217;d love to help you get the word out.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>I&#8217;m not an athlete. I&#8217;m a geek. I’ve been working with SaaS companies since 2008. I was the Product Manager at Sprintly and Mailout.</p>
<p>Around 2012, I started a podcast called <a href="https://productpeople.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product People</a>. I interviewed people like Jason Fried, Hiten Shah, and Rob Walling. Folks loved it. At the same time, my writing on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justinjackson.ca</a> started to gain a lot of traction. People began signing up for <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my newsletter</a> too. They were coming to me for product &amp; marketing advice for their SaaS, software, mobile, and digital products. I offered <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulting calls</a>. That month I had 17 calls booked (that was too many).</p>
<p>When you googled &#8220;justin jackson&#8221; my site was the #1 result.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Are you Justin Jackson from the NBA?&#8221;</h3>
<p>And then, a talented 22-year-old basketball player was drafted by the Sacramento Kings. His name was also Justin Jackson.</p>
<p>I first noticed it when random kids started asking me questions on Snapchat.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1701" data-permalink="https://justinjackson.ca/nba-justin-jackson/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?fit=960%2C314&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="960,314" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Kids asking me if I&#8217;m Justin Jackson the NBA player on Snapchat" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?fit=500%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?fit=600%2C196&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1701" src="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?resize=600%2C196&#038;ssl=1" alt="Kids asking me if I'm Justin Jackson the NBA player on Snapchat" width="600" height="196" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?resize=500%2C164&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg?resize=768%2C251&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I thought it was cute.</p>
<p>And then, I searched &#8220;justin jackson&#8221; on Google again.</p>
<p><strong>It was all NBA.</strong> Goodbye &#8220;nerdy guy from Canada,&#8221; hello &#8220;professional athlete.&#8221;</p>

<p>My search traffic plummeted. People started DMing to say they couldn&#8217;t find my site. When I went to speak at a conference, I had a few people tell me they&#8217;d googled me and didn&#8217;t attend my talk because &#8220;why would I want to hear from a basketball player at a tech conference?&#8221;</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing about it</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m pivoting everything over to the <a href="https://megamaker.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MegaMaker</a> brand.</p>
<p>All my <a href="https://megamaker.co/category/articles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best articles</a> on product marketing will live there.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my products</a> related to product marketing will live there.</p>
<p><em>(btw – <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/thanks/?convertkit=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Marketing Wins 3.0</a> is coming soon! <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/thanks/?convertkit=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to learn more.)</em></p>
<p>And, ultimately, MegaMaker will become something bigger than just me.</p>
<p>Already, I&#8217;ve hired Tim, Gary, and Andre to help me.</p>
<p>Together, we&#8217;re focused on one job:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We help digital product companies fix their product and improve their marketing, so that they can grow profits.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Is there a lesson here for you?</h3>
<p>On Twitter, folks have been asking me:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason a lot of Hollywood stars change their names for the sake of their careers (Marilyn Monroe, Woody Allen). Your name is your brand. The Screen Actors Guild won&#8217;t let new actors join if they have the same name as another member (there can only be one Chuck Norris ?<span class="redactor-invisible-space">).</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>Pros to using your personal name:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re selling personal products and services (consulting, books) it makes sense to use your name. Ie. nathanbarry.com/books</li>
<li>Building a personal brand feels <em>personal</em>. People get connected to you as a person. They&#8217;ll seek out your conference talks, blog posts, videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons to using your personal name:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Would Nathan Barry have been able to use his name if it was Dave Barry? Not a chance. Dave Barry has been an author since 1983.</li>
<li>Personal names can&#8217;t be trademarked (unless it&#8217;s a unique brand you created).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>Company names have their own identity challenges.</strong> I&#8217;m an advisor for <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coach</a>, which often gets confused with Coach.me.</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(Incidentally, MegaMaker has its own SEO problems. Search for &#8220;megamaker&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see someone else is using my name. Luckily, I registered the trademark in January 2017 and can fight it).</span></p>
<p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">I used to wonder why founders got so upset when someone used a name similar to theirs. Now I know!</span></p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
