  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spoken with a lot of folks who don&#8217;t like sales, but want to make a living selling their own products.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the reality: if you want to earn an income from a product you&#8217;ve created &#8211; a web app, an e-book, an iOS app, or desktop software &#8211; you&#8217;re going to put a price on it and ask people to buy.</p>
<p>You might not like it, but there&#8217;s no other way. No one is going to just give you money so that you can achieve your dreams. Truthfully, customers don&#8217;t really care about you; they&#8217;re just regular people looking to solve their own problems.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s not about you</h3>
<p>I keep meeting brilliant people who are building products wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the technical aspects that are wrong; the problem is they&#8217;re not starting with the customer in mind. They&#8217;re starting with themselves. Instead of finding pain that people need solved, they&#8217;re focused on their own needs: they want to use the latest tech, the latest framework, the latest design technique.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about you.</p>
<p>No seriously, it&#8217;s not about you. If you want a business, you can&#8217;t be your own customer.</p>
<p>If you started your project without talking to a single soul you&#8217;re doing it wrong. If you&#8217;ve talked to 100 people, it won&#8217;t matter until you connect with a group of people who need your help. That&#8217;s where you start. Not with yourself, and your ideas, but with other people.</p>
<h3>You&#8217;re not connecting with a real need</h3>
<p>Derek Sivers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBlJVazr4A0">tells a great story</a> about trying to make it in the music business. He hustled for years as a musician, but his career never really took off. Then he created CD Baby, a site that allowed artists to sell their music. This was before PayPal existed, and setting up a shopping cart was difficult. The company he&#8217;d accidentally created in a weekend, took off and became a great success.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d finally created something people wanted. It was like I&#8217;d written a hit song. Once you have a hit, all the locked doors open wide. People love it so much, it seems to promote itself. Don&#8217;t persistently do what&#8217;s not working.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Finding a hit means starting with people (as I mentioned above), and figuring out what they need.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t start with code, or with an idea; you start by listening to people. It&#8217;s inherently difficult to find a genuine pain that others have for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;re inherently self-focused, and not thinking about the needs of others</li>
<li>A lot of legitimate problems have boring solutions, or solutions that require hard work</li>
</ol>
<p>You might be a photographer that really wants to do artsy photo shoots for magazines. But the reality is that there are more weddings that need photographers than artsy magazines. Doing artsy photos is a desire you have for yourself; being a wedding photographer connects with a need people actually have. You can test this easily by searching Craigslist: how many people are looking for wedding photographers? How many people want to pay you just so you can express yourself creatively in a way that is satisfying only to you?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/379604145130708992">Good products start with the line: <em>&#8220;People need me to&#8230;&#8221;</em> not <em>&#8220;I want to&#8230;&#8221;</em>.</a></p>
<h3>Tell me about what you&#8217;re selling</h3>
<p>Whenever people tell me they&#8217;ve built a new product, I ask them to tell me about it, or show me the web page.</p>
<p>This is where words really matter. Every elevator pitch, landing page, or sales letter basically boils down to this formula:</p>
<blockquote><p>You (the customer) have ___ problem.</p>
<p>Hire my product, and you&#8217;ll solve that problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it. However, that&#8217;s easier said than done (I&#8217;m constantly revising my sales copy: <a href="http://jfdi.bz">here</a> and <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/book/amplification/">here</a>). The key is to keep it as simple and as direct as you can. The customer doesn&#8217;t need to hear about your philosophy or your ideals. They don&#8217;t need to hear your mission statement. All they want to know is: &#8220;Can you solve my problem?&#8221;</p>
<h3>You need to appeal to the person with the checkbook</h3>
<p>This is often the hardest part for creatives to swallow. When you&#8217;re selling to businesses, you&#8217;re not appealing to the cool, hip designer, or the brilliant engineer. Usually, you&#8217;re selling to a boring manager with a checkbook. They don&#8217;t care about what framework you used for your software, or about that beautiful font pairing you made. Generally they only care about four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How will this make me more money?</li>
<li>How will this save me more money?</li>
<li>How will this save me more time?</li>
<li>How will this make me look good?</li>
</ol>
<p>I know: capitalistic, boring, pragmatic and vain. And yet while things like user experience, design, and technical architecture <em>do</em> matter over the long haul, they&#8217;re not going to get you the sale up-front. Your value proposition is what gets you the sale; everything else helps you keep the sale (or creates repeat sales).</p>
<h3>Still want to do this?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re serious about making a living on products, you&#8217;re going to need to sell.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to do: identify a real problem, and then clearly communicate the solution to the person with the checkbook.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
