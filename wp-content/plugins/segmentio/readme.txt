Analytics for WordPress lets you integrate more than 100 analytics and marketing tools with the flick of a switch.


== Description ==

Analytics for WordPress is the easiest way to integrate analytics and marketing tools into your WordPress site.

Instead of installing each tool individually, just install Segment's WordPress plugin and use Segment to integrate third-party analytics and marketing tools.   Once you're setup, you can swap and add new analytics services with the flick of a switch!

Here's how it works:
* Install the Segment plugin
* Segment will automatically start tracking how people are using your site – what pages they view and the information they provide to you, like their emails
* Go to the Segment control panel, and toggle on any tool you want to try like Google Analytics, KISSmetrics and Facebook Audiences
* Segment will send this data along to each tool
* The service is fully integrated into your site–zero code required!

You can use Segment to try out more than a hundred vendors in a number of categories. Here are just a few of our most popular integrations:
* **Advertising** – AdRoll, Google Adwords, Facebook Audiences, Twitter Ads, Quantcast, AppNexus
* **Analytics** – Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Chartbeat, Go Squared
* **CRM** – Salesforce, Zendesk, Gainsight, Frontleaf
* **Email** – Customer.io, Outbound, Vero, Marketo, MailChimp, Hubspot
* **Optimization** – Optimizely, CrazyEgg, Visual Website Optimizer

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What analytics services does it support? =
Tons! Google Analytics, Mixpanel, KISSmetrics, Chartbeat, Clicky, Intercom, CrazyEgg, Customer.io, Gauges, GoSquared, HubSpot, Marketo, Olark, Quantcast, Vero, and more... You can check out [the full list](https://segment.io/integrations).

= What user information does it record automatically? =
We automatically identify users that are logged in to your WordPress site, and record their `name`, `email`, `username`, and `website`, so you don't need to write any special code to handle that yourself. It also identifies commenters if it can.

= Which actions does it record automatically? =
We automatically record the different types of WordPress pages your users can visit. Things like "View About Page", "View Post", "View Author Page", etc. So you don't have to worry about recording them yourself. Just by enabling the plugin you'll already be recording all of those actions.

= Can I turn off the automatic event tracking? =
Yup! You can also turn off specific events, in case you only want a few.

= Can I ignore logged-in users? =
Yup! You can even _just_ ignore Administrators or Editors too.

= I'm a developer, what should I know? =

Lots of new goodies for developers in the 1.0.0 release!

So very much.  The two biggest enhancements for developers are the introduction of the `segment_get_current_user_identify` and `segment_get_current_page_track` filters.  As a developer, you can hook into these filters and add any sort of conditional logic you want to track any event on a page, or customize the user identification system to hook into your own user system as needed.  Super extensible!

Beyond that, we've completely refactored the plugin to use all of the appropriate WordPress APIs (Like the Settings API) and have added a easily extendable abstract class for eCommerce platforms.  On top of all of that, all of our filters, classes, functions and methods are fully documented inline.

Need to add custom settings?  By hooking into our `segment_default_settings` and `segment_settings_core_validation` filters, you can quickly and easily add your own settings to the Segment plugin.
