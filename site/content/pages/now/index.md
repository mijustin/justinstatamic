title: Now
post_content: |
  This year, in [current_date format='Y'], I'm building a new podcasting startup with my friend Jon Buda. It's called <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a>. If you need podcast hosting, let me know!
  
  I also run <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> (resources for indie entrepreneurs). This is what's paying the bills while I build Transistor! My offerings include <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a> and <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt">Jolt</a>, which have sold 6,000+ copies.
