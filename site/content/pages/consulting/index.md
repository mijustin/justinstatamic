If you're running an online business (SaaS, digital products, e-commerce), it's likely you have these struggles:

<ul>
    <li>People aren't discovering you online.</li>
    <li>The top of your funnel isn't producing enough leads.</li>
    <li>People try your product and don't come back.</li>
    <li>You can't retain the paying customers you have.</li>
    <li>Your competitors are getting all the attention.</li>
    <li>Growth was good for years, but now it's flat.</li>
    <li>Your product isn't generating any word of mouth.</li>
    <li>You're not converting visitors to paying customers.</li>
</ul>

I can help you overcome these obstacles.

I've been helping software companies, digital agencies, and small businesses improve sales online <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/mediahead.png">since 1999</a>.

<h3>How I can help you</h3>

I base everything on this premise: <em>people don't just see an ad and buy.</em> There are multiple touchpoints that need to occur in a product purchase:

With that timeline in mind, here's how I can get you more sales:

<h4>I create viral content for you</h4>

When you get more traffic into the top of your funnel, people will begin to recognize who you are, and what you offer. It's also a great opportunity to get their contact information.

You've probably seen some of the campaigns I've created. Here's a few:

<h4>I turn traffic into leads</h4>

Traffic isn't enough. What good is traffic if you don't know who is visiting your site?  The best way I've found is <strong>offering a free email course</strong>. I can help you create a high quality course that generates qualified leads for your business.

<h4>I turn leads into customers</h4>

Leads aren't enough. Using drip email sequence and retargeting, we can nurture those leads until they become paying customers.

<blockquote>Justin was an absolute powerhouse at Sprintly. He helped diagnose churn, figure out what was up with our MRR, and contributed a great personality to the Sprintly brand.

If you're reading this and are any position to hire Justin, you should stop reading this and figure out how to woo him from whatever he's doing right now.

<h3>How to hire me</h3>

Clients hire me to help make real progress on their business. They're tired of procrastinating on marketing. They want more leads and more customers.

I offer consulting calls in two-month packages. You'll get 2 personal coaching calls with me (one each month).

These calls are designed to tackle your marketing challenges. I’ll offer specific tactics for your business. Afterwords, you'll get a recording and a to-do list.

&nbsp;

<h4>Before your call:</h4>

You'll receive a series of questions designed to give me an idea of your goals, what you've tried so far, and what's already working for you.

I research your product beforehand so that we can dive right into actionable advice on the call. This includes looking at your website, signing up for a trial, reading some of your content, and seeing which channels you're currently using.

<h4>During your call:</h4>

We'll start with a few follow-up questions. Then we'll dive right into a handful of tactics you can apply.

<h4>After the session, you’ll receive:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>A list of takeaways you can use</li>
    <li>An outline of the call</li>
