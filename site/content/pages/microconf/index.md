      <p>Going to MicroConf 2022 in Minneapolis, MN? Here are my best tips on travel, hotels, taxi, and my guide for getting the most out of this conference for bootstrapped entrepreneurs.</p><p>The brainchild of <a href="https://medium.com/u/bb46c9d797d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Walling</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/82ce8b58e99c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Taber</a>, this event bucks the startup trend: it‚Äôs <em>not </em>for venture-funded companies.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúMicroConf is a great place to meet like-minded people who are self-funding their businesses. It‚Äôs one of the best places to make friends with other people in the same situation as you. In fact, it is one of the few places you can do that!‚Äù? ‚Äì&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/479830773d90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hiten Shah</a></p></blockquote><h2>Who should attend?</h2><p>Generally, you're a good fit for the MicroConf Growth conference if you're making a full-time income from a digital product (SaaS, software, other). Officially the conference website says:</p><blockquote><p>MicroConf Growth is focused on founders who are looking to grow their company into a seven-or eight-figure business.</p></blockquote><p>MicroConf does run other <a href="https://microconf.com/upcoming-events">events</a> for folks who are just getting started. These can be a good fit if you're still consulting (or working a day job) and building something on the side.</p><h2>What day and time should I fly in?</h2><p>Many folks will fly in a day before the conference to hang out and tour around. I always regret it when I arrive at the conference the day it‚Äôs starting.</p><blockquote><p>"Based on my past experience,&nbsp;it's better to arrive early then try to stay longer after the conference. If you want to add a vacation to the trip, add it before the conference instead of adding it after." ‚Äì Benedikt Deicke, <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/dac7ceeb">Slow &amp; Steady</a></p></blockquote><p>For MicroConf Growth (April 3 - 5, 2022), I recommend arriving early, on&nbsp;Saturday (April 2), and if you can, check out on Wednesday (April 6). However, if you arrive early in the day on April 3rd you'll be fine.</p><h2>The hallway&nbsp;track</h2><p>The ‚Äúhallway track‚Äù refers to hanging out with other attendees outside of the main talks.</p><p>
      
      This might mean grabbing a coffee with another attendee, joining a table for breakfast, or hanging out in the lobby outside the conference room.
      
      People often say that this informal hangout time is the best part about MicroConf.
      
      </p><p>Here are a few things to remember:</p><p><strong>Make a plan for who you would like to meet, and what topics you want to discuss.</strong> If you have specific folks you‚Äôd like to ask questions of, write a list of their names and what topic you‚Äôd like to discuss.</p><p><strong>But‚Ä¶ also be open to meeting ‚Äúsleeper attendees.‚Äù</strong> At any event, there are always people <em>everyone</em> wants to talk to, and then there are folks who aren‚Äôt as well-known. Outside of the bloggers, podcasters, and ‚Äúinternet famous‚Äù people you‚Äôve heard of, there are tons of amazing entrepreneurs at MicroConf, with awesome stories to tell.</p><p><strong>Rehearse your answer to: <em>‚Äúwhat are you working on?‚Äù </em></strong>People at MicroConf are curious! They‚Äôll want to know what you‚Äôre working on. Don‚Äôt be self-conscious. Just tell them about your main project, or pitch them on your business idea.</p><p>One idea is to<strong> host a reception in your room </strong>during the evenings. Buy some drinks, and give out personal invitations (be sure to invite a wide variety of people!)</p><p><strong>Joining others for a meal or coffee&nbsp;</strong>can be a great opportunity to meet new people. (See below for good options around the hotel).</p><p><strong>Be vulnerable. </strong>You don‚Äôt need to pretend at MicroConf. If you‚Äôre struggling with something, share it with others! It‚Äôs likely other people have been where you‚Äôre at now. Be open and honest; no need to fake it.</p><hr><h2>The talks</h2><p>MicroConf talks are <em>packed</em> with tactics. Want to get the most out of them?</p><p><strong>Leave your laptop in your room.</strong> It‚Äôs way too easy to get distracted during a talk by Slack, your email, and other work that needs to be done. Bring a pen and paper, or write notes on your iPhone.</p><p><strong>You don‚Äôt need to take photos of each slide.</strong> Most speakers make their slides available afterwards, and the talks are also recorded. Christian Genco writes awesome recaps at&nbsp;<a href="https://microconf.gen.co/">microconf.gen.co</a>.</p><p><strong>Enjoying a talk? Let the speaker know!</strong> Quote a notable line on Twitter (use the #microconf hashtag), or tell them afterwards.</p><hr><h2>Giving a&nbsp;talk?</h2><p>MicroConf is unique in that there are keynote talks as well as talks from attendees. Here are some tips for speaking at MicroConf:</p><ul><li><strong>Practice.</strong> When it comes to being prepared, practising your talk (out loud) trumps everything else.</li><li><strong>Practice your talk in front of an audience.</strong>&nbsp;Give your talk in front of your family, friends, or at a meetup.</li><li><strong>Watch past attendee talks. </strong>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/microconf">find them here on Youtube</a>. Observe what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Remember, you don‚Äôt have a lot of time, so you need to be succinct and focus on a few key points.</li></ul><hr><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>How good is MicroConf?</h3><blockquote><p>"It‚Äôs really great, but because of all the like-minded people there are to meet and learn from, not because of the talks. I think it would be even better if they cut down on the speaking and added more structured opportunities for discussions, especially for the introverts." ‚Äì Adam Wathan</p></blockquote><h3>How should I handle a hotel, taxi and the airport?</h3><p>Taking a Lyft/Uber from the airport to downtown seems to be the preferred option.</p><p>Chris Moffit says:</p><blockquote><p>"You can take the light rail from the Minneapolis‚àíSaint Paul International Airport to downtown but its a 9-10 block walk from the station to the hotel. If it were me, I would take an Uber. April in Minnesota can be unpredictable."</p></blockquote><h3>What's the best coffee, restaurants, and bars close to Hyatt Regency Minneapolis?</h3><h4>Coffee:</h4><ul><li>Derrick Reimer says: "There are a few&nbsp;<a href="http://justinstatamic.test/cp/pages/edit/Dunn%20Brothers%20Coffee">Dunn Brothers Coffee</a>&nbsp;shops in the vicinity, which is a local chain. Better than Starbucks, but not quite Penny‚Äôs or Spyhouse in hipsterdom."</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hPMDU3V7sUP6WokQ6">Grayfox Coffee &amp; Wine</a>&nbsp;looks good (10-minute walk from the hotel)</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bXdHBpPZmT2vxUD67">Spyhouse Coffee</a>&nbsp;is supposed to be good, but it's about a twenty-minute walk. (Brandon Bayer's favorite place).</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1oWz9DccKwNnt8pv8">Penny's Coffee</a>&nbsp;is also highly rated, but a twenty-minute walk in the same direction.</li></ul><h4>Breakfast:</h4><ul><li>"<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8A6gBGfyWAzmBDB77">Eggy‚Äôs</a> is a nice breakfast place in close walking distance." - Brandon Bayer</li></ul><h4>Food + pubs:</h4><ul><li><a href="http://the-local.com/">The Local</a>: Jace Richardson says "The Local is a great bar and you'll probably end up there like 19 times. Food is quite good there as well." (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/P9tKGZWT3aXaiHLcA">Google Maps</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.butcherandtheboar.com/">Butcher and the Boar</a>: "good for meat lovers" says Derrick Reimer. (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sNZocQC5E9f3SRWeA">Google Maps</a>)<br></li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nFqKun4akbUaKWvb6">Constantine:</a> another recommendation from&nbsp;Derrick Reimer:&nbsp;"craft cocktails, great burgers."<br></li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DFi1HF3QGyZj1uq89">Black Sheep Pizza</a>: Daniel Lavin says "it's üî•."</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/R6Cq7BNYEDQAPBWh7">Smack Shack</a>: seafood restaurant (recommended by Aaron Ackerman)</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fsPNixZs1T81wmBC6">Galaxy Pizza</a> "is freaking amazing with great vegan and gluten-free options (7 min drive)" says Brandon Bayer</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kuD1GAut7URTcE4j9">Gorkha Palace</a> is fantastic Nepali, Indian food (10 min drive)</li></ul><h3>What's the dress code at MicroConf?</h3><blockquote><p>"It ranges from ultra-casual to business casual. Be comfortable. But the room is usually chilly, so plan accordingly." ‚Äì&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dchurchville">Dave Churchville</a></p></blockquote><p>You'll see a lot of folks in jeans, t-shirts, button-up shirts. You'll also see some folks who are in shorts!</p><blockquote><p>"You‚Äôll spend most of the time indoors where they keep the A/C cranked, so it gets surprisingly chilly. At night, it also gets cooler than you would think, so I would recommend a sweater or light jacket." ‚Äì&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/delongshot">Adam Delong</a></p></blockquote><h2>Other advice</h2><ul><li><strong>Check your passport well before you leave.&nbsp;</strong>Is it up to date? Does it need to be renewed?</li><li><strong>Don't spend too much time in your hotel room. </strong>You‚Äôll definitely need some rest, but if you hide in your room the whole time, you‚Äôll miss out. MicroConf is about building relationships. If you go to any of the hotel restaurants, you can usually find other attendees.</li><li><strong>Add Slack to your phone.</strong> The MicroConf Slack chat&nbsp;is the main communication channel. It‚Äôs where a lot of the planning for social get-togethers happens.</li><li><strong>Don‚Äôt drink too much alcohol.</strong> There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having a few drinks with other attendees. But being hungover is the worst! Take it slow.</li></ul><h2>Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://microconf.gen.co/" target="_blank">MicroConf 2019 notes</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Christian Genco</li><li><a href="http://uibreakfast.com/microconf-europe-2015-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to enjoy your next conference</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/79265580815f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Portman</a></li></ul>
