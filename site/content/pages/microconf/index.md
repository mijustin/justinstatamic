      <p>Going to MicroConf 2020 in Minneapolis, MN? Here are my best tips on travel, hotels, taxi, and my guide for getting the most out of this conference for bootstrapped entrepreneurs.</p><p>The brainchild of <a href="https://medium.com/u/bb46c9d797d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Walling</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/82ce8b58e99c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Taber</a>, this event bucks the startup trend: it’s <em>not </em>for venture-funded companies.</p><blockquote><p><em>“MicroConf is a great place to meet like-minded people who are self-funding their businesses. It’s one of the best places to make friends with other people in the same situation as you. In fact, it is one of the few places you can do that!”? –&nbsp;</em><a href="https://medium.com/u/479830773d90" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hiten Shah</em></a></p></blockquote><h2>Which version should you attend? Growth or Starter?</h2><p>
      
      If you're making a full-time income from a digital product (SaaS, software, other) you should go to <a href="http://www.microconf.com/growth/">Growth</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're still consulting (or working a day job) and building something on the side, go to <a href="http://www.microconf.com/starter/">Starter</a>. If you attend Starter, come in a day or two early, and you'll still be able to meet folks from Growth!</p><h2>What day and time should I fly in?</h2><p>Many folks will fly in a day before the conference to hang out and tour around. I always regret it when I arrive at the conference the day it’s starting.</p><blockquote><p>"Based on my past experience,&nbsp;it's better to arrive early then try to stay longer after the conference. If you want to add a vacation to the trip, add it before the conference instead of adding it after. Otherwise, you won't really enjoy the vacation because you'll be too pumped up from the conference with all the ideas and stuff. You'll want to get back to work!" – Benedikt Deicke, <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/dac7ceeb">Slow &amp; Steady</a></p></blockquote><p>For Growth Edition (April 19 - 21, 2020), I recommend arriving early, on&nbsp;Friday (April 18), and if you can, check out on Wednesday (April 22). However, if you arrive early in the day on April 19th you'll be fine.</p><p>For Starter Edition (April 21 - 23, 2020), I recommend arriving on&nbsp;Monday (April 20), and if you can, check out on Friday (April 24). If you arrive earlier, you'll also get more chances to hang out with folks attending Growth. Arriving early on Tuesday (April 21) would also be fine.</p><h2>Come for the “hallway&nbsp;track.”</h2><p>The “hallway track” refers to hanging out with other attendees outside of the main talks.</p><p>
      
      This might mean grabbing a coffee with another attendee, joining a table for breakfast at <a href="http://www.troplv.com/dining/bacio">Bacio</a>, or hanging out in the lobby outside the conference room.
      
      People often say that this informal hangout time is the best part about MicroConf.
      
      </p><p>Here are a few things to remember:</p><p><strong>Make a plan for who you want meet, and what topics you want to discuss.</strong> If you have specific folks you’d like to ask questions of, write a list of their names and what topic you’d like to discuss.</p><p><strong>But… also be open to meeting “sleeper attendees.”</strong> At any event, there’s always people <em>everyone</em> wants to talk to, and then there are folks who aren’t as well-known. Outside of the bloggers, podcasters, and “internet famous” people you’ve heard of, there are tons of amazing entrepreneurs at MicroConf, with awesome stories to tell.</p><p><strong>Rehearse your answer to: <em>“what are you working on?” </em></strong>People at MicroConf are curious! They’ll want to know what you’re working on. Don’t be self-conscious. Just tell them about your main project, or pitch them on your business idea.</p><p>One idea is to<strong> host a reception in your room </strong>during the evenings. Buy some drinks, and give out personal invitations (be sure to invite a wide variety of people!)</p><p><strong>Breakfast </strong>can be a great opportunity to meet new people. Wander down to the <a href="http://www.troplv.com/dining/bacio">Bacio</a>&nbsp;in the morning, and ask to join a table!</p><p><strong>Be vulnerable. </strong>You don’t need to pretend at MicroConf. If you’re struggling with something, share it with others! It’s likely other people have been where you’re at now. Be open and honest; no need to fake it.</p><hr><h2>The talks</h2><p>MicroConf talks are <em>packed</em> with tactics. Want to get the most out of them?</p><p><strong>Leave your laptop in your room.</strong> It’s way too easy to get distracted during a talk by Slack, your email, and other work that needs to be done. Bring a pen and paper, or write notes on your iPhone.</p><p><strong>You don’t need to take photos of each slide.</strong> Most speakers make their slides available afterwords, and the talks are also recorded. <a href="https://medium.com/u/29800485b813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai Davis</a> also writes notes at <a href="http://microconfrecap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microconfrecap.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Enjoying a talk? Let the speaker know!</strong> Quote a notable line on Twitter (use the #microconf hashtag), or tell them afterwards.</p><hr><h2>Giving a&nbsp;talk?</h2><p>MicroConf is unique in that there are keynote talks as well as talks from attendees. Here are some tips for speaking at MicroConf:</p><ul><li><strong>Practice.</strong> When it comes to being prepared, practicing your talk (out loud) trumps everything else.</li><li><strong>Practice your talk in front of an audience.</strong> Do your talk in front of your family, friends, or at a meetup.</li><li><strong>Watch past attendee talks. </strong>You can <a href="https://vimeo.com/user12790628/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find them here on Vimeo</a>. Observe what works and what doesn’t. Remember, you don’t have a lot of time, so you need to be succinct and focus on a few key points.</li></ul>
      
      <hr><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>How good is MicroConf?</h3><blockquote><p>"It’s really great, but because of all the like-minded people there are to meet and learn from, not because of the talks. I think it would be even better if they cut down on the speaking and added more structured opportunities for discussions, especially for the introverts." – Adam Wathan</p></blockquote><h3>How should I handle hotel, taxi and the airport?</h3><p>My friend <a href="https://medium.com/u/a086f454e7ba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jimmy Jacobson</a>, of <a href="https://www.wedgies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wedgies</a>, lives in Las Vegas. Here is his advice:</p><blockquote><p><em>You can use Uber or Lyft at the airport, but just make sure you pay attention to the notice that they will pick you up on level 2M of the parking garage (that’s one level up from passenger pickup).</em></p></blockquote>
      
      <blockquote><p><em>If you are cool with a taxi, then just follow the signs to the taxi stand. It’s fast and efficient as well.</em></p></blockquote>
      
      <blockquote><p><em>The Cosmopolitan is reasonably close to </em><a href="http://www.troplv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Tropicana</em></a><em> and has one of the only non chain coffee shops on the strip. It also has some good but reasonably priced eats (for the strip).</em></p></blockquote><h3>What's the dress code at MicroConf?</h3><blockquote><p>"It ranges from ultra-casual to business casual. Be comfortable. But the room is usually chilly, so plan accordingly." –&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dchurchville">Dave Churchville</a></p></blockquote><p>
      
      You'll see a lot of folks in jeans, t-shirts, button-up shirts. You'll also see some folks who are in shorts!
      
      </p><blockquote><p>"You’ll spend most of the time indoors where they keep the A/C cranked, so it gets surprisingly chilly. At night, it also gets cooler than you would think, so I would recommend a sweater or light jacket." – <a href="https://twitter.com/delongshot">Adam Delong</a></p></blockquote><h3>What's the best coffee close to Tropicana?</h3><p>
      
      Starbucks has a stranglehold on the Strip; so if that's your preference your in luck.
      
      If you're looking for independent coffee, the closest spot to Tropicana is <a href="http://www.sunrisecoffeelv.com/">Sunrise Coffee</a> on the other side of the airport. It's good.
      
      Vesta is not close, but it's a great newer coffee roaster in town.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Other advice</h2><ul><li><strong>Check your passport well before you leave.&nbsp;</strong>Is it up to date? Does it need to be renewed?</li><li><strong>Bring lip balm and drink lots of water.</strong> It's a desert. Your lips are going to get really dry. You're going to need to stay hydrated.</li><li><strong>Push yourself out of your hotel room. </strong>You’ll definitely need some rest, but if you hide in your room the whole time, you’ll miss out. MicroConf is about building relationships. If you go to any of the hotel restaurants, you can usually find other attendees.</li><li><strong>Add Slack to your phone.</strong> The MicroConf Slack chat&nbsp;is the main communication channel. It’s where a lot of the planning for social get-togethers happens.</li><li><strong>Don’t drink too much alcohol.</strong> Las Vegas is a party town, and there’s nothing wrong with having a few drinks with other attendees. But being hungover is the worst! Take it slow.</li></ul><h2>Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://kaidavis.com/microconf-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MicroConf First Time Attender Guide</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/29800485b813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai Davis</a></li><li><a href="http://uibreakfast.com/microconf-europe-2015-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to enjoy your next conference</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/79265580815f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Portman</a></li><li><a href="http://christian.gen.co/microconf2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MicroConf 2016 notes</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/4440911e235c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Genco</a></li></ul>
