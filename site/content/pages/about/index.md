    text: '<p>For me, computers opened up a whole new world of creativity and connection. By the time I was a teenager, I was heavily involved in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a>&nbsp;scene. Bulletin board systems were really the precursor to the web the way we know it today. I was able to connect with people from all around the world.</p><p>The operator of Absolute Future BBS asked me to co-sysop his board when I was 13. This is when I started getting interested in marketing and business. Here''s a line from my diary:</p><blockquote><p>On the BBS, I mostly create artwork as well as some other tasks. With my help, we''ve jumped from 35 users to 236 (in 3 months!).</p></blockquote><p>I posted about our launch on&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/alt.bbs.ads/c/jRqDjtR8CZo?pli=1">Usenet</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.bbs.misc/c/40z321LUsM8">groups</a>, on&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">FidoNet</a>, invited people personally on message boards, and did&nbsp;<a href="http://sixteencolors.net/">ANSI</a>&nbsp;artwork for other BBSes in exchange for advertising.</p><p>The BBS scene also showed me how independent developers could create and sell software online. I watched Seth Hamilton release&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboBOARD/FX">Roboboard/FX</a>. It was shareware, which you could download for free. But you could unlock additional features by paying for an upgrade (back then, you had to send a check in the mail!).</p><h3>In grade 12, I put on a rave in my hometown</h3><p>My buddy, Adrian, and I wanted to bring that big-city rave experience to our little town of 7,000 people.</p><p>It was 1998, and I was 17 years old. By some miracle, I still have the Word and Excel files we used to plan the event. Our budget was $1,232.48:</p>'

    text: '<p>We ended up selling out the event and netted a nice profit ($1,000 I believe).</p><h2>College and a side-business</h2><p>I didn''t want to go to college at all, but my dad convinced me to get my Business Management diploma.</p><p>Initially, I got a job as a bellboy at a local hotel but then decided to quit and start a business. I was able to get a student business loan, and I bought a computer and a video camera. I called my new company Mediahead Productions.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>That summer I started doing web design and video production.</p><h2>Post-graduation</h2><p>After graduating, I became a manager with a non-profit. But my desire to run a business continued.</p><p>In my early 20s, I opened a skateboard and snowboard shop with my friend. I''d dreamt about it since I was a teenager. I was passionate about snowboarding, and I''d spent two years working on the manufacturing side. I was looking forward to earning a profit from doing something I loved.</p>'

    text: '<p>Ultimately, I learned that retail is a hard business, with small margins. We tried to make it work for as long as we could, before closing the shop in 2005. (Those lessons ended up inspiring this post: <i><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/margin">Good businesses have margins</a>.)</i></p><h2>First tech job</h2><p>After losing the Real Deal, I was flustered. I had a university education in business, but I didn’t understand how business worked.</p><p>Then in 2008, I got a call from a guy named Gregg. He wanted to hire me to work at his tech startup, Mailout Interactive. I learned a lot from him. He was the one who introduced me to 37signals, and their book <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real">Getting Real</a>. I read the whole thing that day.</p><p>I started going to tech conferences. I took a workshop from Mike McDerment, the founder of Freshbooks, called "How to build a Web app from A-Z.” I bought books and online courses.</p><p>{{ workingon }}</p>'
