title: 'My story'

  Hi, I'm Justin Jackson. This is my story.
  
  <h3>In 1983</h3>
  
  My family got our first computer: a Commodore Vic-20. I was fascinated by it. I spent hours trying to figure out BASIC, and made a few little programs.

  <h3>In 1985</h3>
  
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">My family flew from Alberta to Texas to visit my grandparents. We celebrated my fifth birthday there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My grandpa, who was a carpenter, gave me a tool box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  He tried</span> to teach me how to hammer a nail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  I bent every one. I’ve never been good with building anything with my hands.</span></span></p>
  
  <h3>In 1989</h3>
  
  We got our second computer: a <a href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue106/reviews_tandy.php">Tandy 1000 SL</a> from Radio Shack. It included some music making software, and the GW-BASIC editor. I started creating little songs and coding little programs.
  
  <h3 class="p1">In 1994</h3>
  
  I was 13. <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/justin-jackson-nerd-mullet.jpg">I looked like this</a>. I loved computers, and had begged my parents to buy me a 2400 BAUD modem. I immediately started calling local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> numbers. I lived on an acreage in Alberta (just outside of Edmonton) and found a BBS called <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/growth-hacker/">Absolute Future</a>. The owner of the BBS made me Co-SysOp, which I remember being a huge deal.
  
  I was homeschooled (check out <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/justin-jackson-nerd-mullet.jpg">this haircut</a>). I did all my schoolwork on the computer, and spent a lot of time experimenting.
  
  My parents' friend gave me access to the internet through the local university. I could use Telnet and Gopher to explore different servers. I also got access to UseNet groups (my faves were alt.hackers, alt.2600, and alt.binaries).
  
  This was also the year I was introduced to Mosaic, the first GUI web browser. I was instantly intrigued by the web, and started fooling around with HTML.
  
  <h3>In 1998</h3>
  
  I turned 18, moved out of my parent's home, and started going to college in Edmonton. I got a job as a bellboy at a hotel, but really wanted to start my own company.
  
  The next summer I quit my job and created Mediahead Productions. I got a small BDC loan and bought a Pentium PC, and a Sony TRV-900 video camera. I paid the loan back by the end of the summer.

  <h3>In 1999</h3>
  
  One of my business ideas was to make videos at summer camps. I'd go and take video of camp activities, and at the end of the week I'd sell VHS tapes to campers for $20 each.
  
  This is how I met my wife. I was making these camp videos, and she was a camp councillor. We started dating at the end of the summer.
  
  <h3>In 2001</h3>
  
  &nbsp;
  
  I got married this year, and we're still married. ;)
  
  At this point, my little business was still paying my bills. I was doing a lot of website design and multimedia production. My original plan was to grow my company into a full studio.
  
  But, plans changed.
  
  For reasons that seem odd now, I became a youth pastor. I worked with teenagers for the next 7 years.

  <h3>In 2002</h3>
  
  A friend and I decided to start a skateboard and snowboard shop called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/9819590930/">The Real Deal</a>. My friend managed the shop. I was still working full-time, and would help out whenever I could.
  
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070226200609/http://www.therealdeal.ca/sad.htm">In 2006 we decided to close it</a>. That year I almost had a breakdown. I wrote about the experience <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/the-principle-that-changed-my-life/">here</a>. At this point, my wife and decided we wouldn't do anything else major on the side until our kids were in school.

  <h3>In 2008</h3>
  
  A pivotal year. I decided to look for a new job. I wanted to get back into technology work. I'd been away from the web for 7 years, and I was scared. I had a family to support, and my web skills were rusty. I was 28, and compared to the rest of the tech industry, already felt old.
  
  My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/greggoldring">Gregg</a> gave me a great opportunity. He invited me to come work with him at <a href="http://mailout.com">Mailout</a>. The first day on the job, he introduced me to 37signals and their book, <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>.
  
  Getting Real is the original manifesto written by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, and describes the philosophy they used to build Basecamp. Before this book, I had built a few "things" but had focused mostly on offering services. Now, I had a vision for building products.
  
  <h3>In 2012</h3>
  
  I went for a beer with a brilliant designer / developer named <a href="http://kylefox.ca/">Kyle Fox</a>. I'd just moved to Vernon, BC, and was back in Edmonton for business. When I flew back home, Kyle messaged me and said: "We should start a podcast about products."
  
  On October 2012, we recorded our first episode of <a href="http://productpeople.tv/">Product People</a>.

  <h3>In 2013</h3>
  
  I published <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/words.html">the most popular thing</a> I've ever written. It was also the year I released my first solo project in years: a little guide called <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/book/amplification/">Amplification</a>. Soon after, I started a private community called <a href="http://jfdi.bz/campfire/">JFDI</a>. You can <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/2013-revenue-stats/">read my year in review here</a>.
  
  <h3>In 2014</h3>
  
  Another pivotal year. I left <a href="http://mailout.com">Mailout</a>, and created my own company, <a href="http://nerdnorth.com">Nerd North Inc</a> with my wife. I started doing product marketing consulting full-time. All of our kids were in school. This meant more freedom for side-projects. You can <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/2014-a-year-of-making-stuff/">read about all the details here</a>.
  
  <h3>In 2015</h3>
  
  I created a new podcast called <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net">Build &amp; Launch</a>. The premise of the show was that I would create a new product every week. The show did very well. <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/products/">I created a bunch of things</a>. This was also the year that I finally finished <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/marketingfordevelopers">Marketing for Developers</a>.
  
  <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz" rel="attachment wp-att-1280"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/mfd-banner.png" alt="Marketing for Developers by Justin Jackson" width="1336" height="600" /></a>
  
  At the end of the year, I decided to quit consulting and make the leap to "full-time product person."
  
  <h3>2016</h3>
  
  This was the year I went independent. No employment income. No consulting income. My family and I would be fully reliant on product income.
  
  I started the year by launching the <a href="http://megamaker.co/challenge">2016 Maker Challenge</a> and a new podcast called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/megamaker/id1074661788">MegaMaker</a>.
  
  This new podcast is interesting, because it's pushed me to go beyond the safe "digital" world into the real world. The first episodes 3-5 focused on creating a menu item, working in the kitchen all day, and then launching it as a Friday lunch special at <a href="http://stationbbq.com">Station BBQ</a> in Vernon, BC. The whole experience was humbling and gave me a <em>lot </em>of perspective: the restaurant / service industry is <em>hard.</em>
