    text: '<p>A big part of my article focused on how I''d previously been given this advice:</p><blockquote><p>"It is far&nbsp;easier to create something that will increase&nbsp;revenue&nbsp;by $200 a month than it is to squeeze $200 out of&nbsp;expensesâ€‹."<br></p></blockquote><p>I was wrestling with this in December 2017.&nbsp;My gut was telling me&nbsp;to reduce&nbsp;my monthly business expenses.</p><p>My ego, however, was saying: "Don''t waste time&nbsp;trying to reduce piddly expenses! You''re a hotshot entrepreneur. Your time is valuable! Just go out and do what entrepreneurs do: earn more revenue."</p><p>Instead of cutting back expenses&nbsp;in 2018, I tried to increase revenue instead.</p><p>But revenue didn''t climb. It fell. For the first time since 2012, my revenue won''t grow this year.</p>'
