      <p>Chris Fox at <a href="http://foxfinancial.ca">Fox Financial</a> was looking for a clean, easy to navigate web site for his clients.Â  He also wanted to streamline his publishing stream: I've set up a system where he blogs regularly, and then uses <a href="http://www.advisormailout.com">Advisor Mailout</a> to import those articles and send out his email newsletter.</p>
