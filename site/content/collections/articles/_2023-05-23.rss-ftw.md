    text: '<p>When Apple introduced podcasts into iTunes in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2005/07/podcast_pocket">2005</a>, Steve Jobs deliberately <a href="https://blog.castopod.org/the-podfather-2-0-the-pioneers-strike-back/">sought out RSS</a> as the underlying technology. Rather than eschewing the open standard, Apple decided to innovate on top of RSS by adding new tags for cover art, podcast categories, descriptions, and more. In doing so, they laid the foundation for an entire podcast ecosystem to thrive.</p><p>Flash forward to 2023, and it''s hard to picture a tech giant like Apple making the same decision. Nowadays, the trend in the tech world is to lock down systems, monopolize distribution channels, and control content. But the idea of adopting a&nbsp;protocol like RSS that can''t be owned? One can almost hear the echo of venture capitalists gnashing their teeth: ''An open protocol that allows anyone to create, manage, and distribute audio content freely? How do we control that?''&nbsp;</p><h2>The Proprietary Profit Motive</h2><p>Proprietary platforms are increasingly determining the content we see on the web. In their bid to maximize profits, venture capitalists and big corporations prefer proprietary systems like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter. The reason is simple: these platforms give them control over content and data, enabling them to monetize their investments more effectively.</p><p>Increasingly, venture capitalists and big corporations determine what we see on the web. And&nbsp;<b>when they invest in&nbsp;<i>platforms,</i>&nbsp;they want them to be proprietary systems</b>&nbsp;like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter. They want to own the whole stack, monetize it, and (ultimately) be the primary beneficiaries of any upside.</p><p>This business strategy typically follows a particular playbook:</p><ol><li>Lure content creators with the promise of increased distribution.</li><li>Initially, provide substantial organic reach for the content.</li><li>Gradually reduce the amount of organic reach each piece of content gets.</li><li>Monetize this content through ads and "boosts," where creators have to pay to reach their audience.</li></ol><h3>Facebook Pages: A Cautionary Tale</h3><p>You can see a stark contrast between open protocols and proprietary platforms in the history of Facebook Pages. Initially, Facebook enticed businesses to create a Facebook Page with the promise of "reaching more customers." Small businesses are always looking for affordable ways to reach customers, so many of them created Pages and promoted them to their customers. However, as soon as Facebook had a critical mass of businesses on its platform, it throttled organic reach, locking businesses into a system where they had to pay to reach their audience.</p><p>Platforms like Medium, Twitter, and Instagram have followed this strategy, leveraging the content of creators to build their platforms, only to restrict access once they reach scale. The bait-and-switch leaves creators and small businesses stuck in a system where they have to pay more for less visibility.</p><h2><strong>Championing Open Protocols</strong></h2><p>The beauty of open protocols like RSS, SMTP, and HTTP lies in their resistance to control by any single entity. While corporations can build email services (like AOL, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Gmail, and Hey), they can''t monopolize the entire ecosystem. As a result, we''re not obligated to pay ''postage fees'' to Microsoft or Google when we send an email, checking the unchecked power of tech giants and preventing them from exploiting their platforms at the expense of creators and users.</p><p>Open standards also foster a healthier digital ecosystem for individual creators, small businesses, and indie developers. Consider the benefits of an open technology like email: a programmer can build an email app using SMTP, a small business can effectively communicate with its customers, and a writer can earn a living by sending an email newsletter to their audience.</p><h2>Podcasting: the RSS Advantage</h2><p>This brings me to RSS and its role in podcasting. Thanks to RSS, the podcasting world has developed into a vibrant ecosystem, offering podcasters a wide range of choices:</p><ol><li>Freedom to record and encode MP3s the way they''d like.<br></li><li>Options to publish their shows on various independent <a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/#best-podcast-hosting-and-analytics-platform">hosting platforms</a>, or even host their own RSS feeds.</li><li>Freedom of speech, especially when they host and distribute their RSS feed themselves.</li><li>Choice of podcast directories and listening apps for distribution.</li><li>Freedom to <a href="https://transistor.fm/make-money-podcasting/">monetize their podcasts</a> as they see fit.</li></ol><p>This freedom is all made possible because RSS is an open standard, impervious to control by any single entity.<br></p><p>In podcasting, there''s no central index. Distribution is decentralized, with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Amazon, Podcast Index, Listen Notes, and others keeping each other in check. This prevents any one entity from dominating the ecosystem and charging podcasters to "boost" content to their listeners.</p><p>Some might argue that having multiple podcast indexes is a weakness, but protocols like DNS have shown us that all that replicating indexes can lead to a more resilient system.</p><h2>Protecting the Open Podcast Ecosystem&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite the merits of open standards, RSS in podcasting has its critics.</p><p>In his&nbsp;<a href="https://mignano.medium.com/the-standards-innovation-paradox-e14cab521391">essay</a>, Michael Mignano, the founder of Anchor (now acquired by Spotify), argues that podcasting needs a proprietary (closed) system. In a subsequent <a href="https://weekly.podnews.net/1538779/8027993">interview on Podland</a>, he describes what he calls "The Standards/Innovation Paradox:"</p><blockquote><p>"The paradox is: when a standard [like RSS] breaks through and gains massive adoption it then becomes very, very hard to change. And the market that it effectively powers stagnates in terms of innovation, because nobody can come to an agreement about what the changes to the standards should be at scale."</p></blockquote><h3>The Reliability of Open Standards Enables Innovation</h3><p>Mignano argues that without centralized control, innovation will stagnate because open standards are "very, very hard to change." <b>However, this stability also enables innovation.</b> For example:</p><ol><li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong>: HTTP enables communication between web clients and servers. Without this foundational standard, none of the modern web-based applications we use daily would be possible: Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, and Instagram.</li><li><strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</strong>: This is the fundamental way devices communicate and transfer data on the Internet. It has enabled technologies like VoIP (Voice over IP) services such as Zoom, livestreaming on YouTube, and online gaming.</li><li><strong>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)</strong>: This open-source project enables developers to add real-time communication capabilities (like video and voice) to their applications. It''s foundational for products like Discord, Google Voice, and Twitter Spaces.</li></ol><h3>Open Standards Generate Opportunities for Small Companies</h3><p>Best of all, open standards don''t just benefit big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon; they also provide opportunities for small, independent companies to build new compelling products:</p><ul><li><a href="https://convertkit.com/?lmref=erdpyA">ConvertKit</a>&nbsp;is a self-funded email newsletter startup built on SMTP.</li><li><a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a>, a new email app from 37signals that competes with larger products from Google like Gmail.</li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a> (the company I co-founded) hosts podcasts, generates feeds, and distributes audio to listeners.</li></ul><p>Mignano seemingly thinks that enabling more indie products and competition in a category is a bad thing. <a href="https://mignano.medium.com/the-standards-innovation-paradox-e14cab521391">In his essay</a> introduction he says:</p><blockquote><p>Despite the benefit of standards-based products being able to reach an audience faster, the tradeoff is that a lower barrier to entry means more products get created in a category, causing market fragmentation and ultimately, a slow pace of innovation.</p></blockquote><p>Mignano is casting "market fragmentation" as a negative attribute. But let''s look at it from another angle: "Market fragmentation" means that a market has a diverse group of products, with no single product exerting monopolistic control.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this&nbsp;is another benefit of open standards: resistance to monopolies. Although large companies may dominate certain areas (like Gmail for email and Apple Podcasts for podcast listening), the open nature of the protocols still allows smaller companies to compete in meaningful ways (Hey for email, Overcast for podcast listening).</p><p>Centralized, pri</p><p>When Mignano talks about "innovation" Mignano alludes to in his essay seems to be an excuse for big tech companies to build proprietary features <i>they desire</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;If this kind of "innovation" only benefits corporations, strips creators of their freedoms, destroys the livelihoods of independent app developers, and imposes a distribution tax on creators, then it''s an innovation we can do without.</p><h2>True Innovation in Podcasting</h2><p>The beauty of RSS lies in its extensibility, as demonstrated by Apple when it added&nbsp;<code>&lt;itunes&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags, enabling podcast cover art, chapters, and more. Today, Google, Apple, and Spotify have all added their tags to the RSS namespace. The Podcasting 2.0 group is moving fast, adding new&nbsp;<code>&lt;podcast&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags, including the ability to add transcripts.</p><p>There''s room for innovation on top of the open RSS system.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, we need more cooperation between podcast hosting providers and app developers to support new &lt;podcast&gt; tags set by the Podcasting 2.0 project. We need a podcast equivalent of the Web Standards Project, which successfully rallied different companies to support open standards set by the W3C.</p><p>The beautiful thing about RSS is that it is extendable.

Plus, the Podcasting 2.0 group is moving fast, adding numerous new&nbsp;<code>&lt;podcast&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags, including the ability to add transcripts.</p><p>Technically, it''s possible to add new features for listeners, like the ability to comment on a podcast episode and have it show up on all platforms.</p><p>Innovation on top of the open RSS system will continue. But to make it go faster, podcast hosting providers and app developers will need to cooperate on supporting new&nbsp;<code>&lt;podcast&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags being set by the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace">Podcasting 2.0 project</a>.</p><p>We need the podcast equivalent of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a>, which was formed in 1998. At the time, the W3C was setting open standards for web development, but browsers were ignoring them (most significantly, Microsoft''s Internet Explorer and Netscape). The purpose of the Web Standards Project was to convince different companies to support the open standard being set by the W3C.&nbsp;<a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/a-short-history-of-wasp-and-why-web-standards-matter/">They succeeded</a>.</p><p>Many say we need to solve the "discoverability" problem for listeners. Is the idea that current podcast listeners are having trouble discovering new shows to listen to?</p>'
