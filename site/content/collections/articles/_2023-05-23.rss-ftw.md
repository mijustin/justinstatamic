    text: '<p>When Apple introduced podcasts into iTunes in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2005/07/podcast_pocket">2005</a>, Steve Jobs deliberately <a href="https://blog.castopod.org/the-podfather-2-0-the-pioneers-strike-back/">sought out RSS</a> as the underlying technology. Rather than eschewing the open standard, Apple decided to innovate on top of RSS by adding new tags for cover art, podcast categories, descriptions, and more. In doing so, they laid the foundation for an entire podcast ecosystem to thrive.</p><p>Flash forward to 2023, and it''s hard to picture a tech giant like Apple making the same decision. Modern tech giants are geared towards centralized systems, monopolizing distribution channels, and controlling content. Today, the idea of adopting a&nbsp;protocol like RSS would cause venture capitalists to gnash their teeth: ''An open protocol that allows anyone to create, manage, and distribute audio content freely? How could we make 100x returns on that?''&nbsp;</p><h2>The Proprietary Profit Motive</h2><p>Proprietary platforms are increasingly determining the content we see on the web. To maximize profits, venture capitalists and big corporations prefer centralized systems over open protocols. The reason is simple: these platforms give them control over content and data, enabling them to monetize their investments more effectively.</p><p>Big tech companies and venture capitalists increasingly determine what we see online. Building a large-scale proprietary platform takes a lot of money. The goal is to own the whole ecosystem, monetize it, and (ultimately) be the primary beneficiaries of any upside.</p><p>To attract users and content creators, platforms like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter typically follow a particular playbook:</p><ol><li>Entice content creators with the promise of increased distribution.</li><li>Initially, provide substantial organic reach for the content.</li><li>Gradually reduce the amount of organic reach each piece of content gets.</li><li>Monetize this content through ads and "boosts," where creators have to pay to reach their audience.</li></ol><p>We''ve seen this scenario play out multiple times now with social media platforms, and I''m worried that it''s now threatening the podcast ecosystem.</p><h3>Facebook Pages: A Cautionary Tale</h3><p>You can see a stark contrast between open protocols and proprietary platforms in the history of Facebook Pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, Facebook enticed businesses to create a Facebook Page with the promise of "reaching more customers." Small businesses are always looking for affordable ways to reach customers, so many created Pages and promoted them to their customers. However, as soon as Facebook had a critical mass of businesses on its platform, it throttled the organic reach of Pages. To reach their audience, businesses had to pay for "boosts."</p><p>Platforms like Medium, Twitter, and Instagram have followed this strategy, leveraging the content of creators to build their platforms, only to restrict access once they reach scale. The bait-and-switch leaves creators and small businesses stuck in a system where they have to pay more for less visibility.</p><h2><strong>Championing Open Protocols</strong></h2><p>The beauty of open protocols like RSS, SMTP, and HTTP is they resist control from any single entity. While corporations can build email services (like AOL, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Gmail, and Hey), they can''t monopolize the entire ecosystem. As a result, we''re not obligated to pay ''postage fees'' to Microsoft or Google when we send an email. Instead, they must be good citizens and stewards of the ecosystem. It''s in Microsoft''s best interests to ensure that Outlook emails are still accepted by Gmail''s mail servers (and vice versa).</p><p>Open standards also foster a healthier digital ecosystem for small businesses and indie developers. For example, a programmer could build an email client that leverages SMTP or POP3 and earn a living without having to pay licensing fees to a larger entity. Recently, we''ve seen how indie devs are adversely affected when a large platform (like Twitter) charges exorbitant rates for API access.</p><h2>Podcasting: the RSS Advantage</h2><p>This brings me to RSS and its role in podcasting. Thanks to RSS, the podcasting world has developed into a vibrant ecosystem, offering podcasters a wide range of choices:</p><ol><li>Freedom to record and encode MP3s the way they''d like.<br></li><li>Options to publish their shows on various independent <a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/#best-podcast-hosting-and-analytics-platform">hosting platforms</a>, or even host their own RSS feeds.</li><li>Freedom of speech, especially when they host and distribute their RSS feed themselves.</li><li>Choice of podcast directories and listening apps for distribution.</li><li>Freedom to <a href="https://transistor.fm/make-money-podcasting/">monetize their podcasts</a> as they see fit.</li></ol><p>This freedom is all made possible because RSS is an open standard, impervious to control by any single entity.<br></p><p>In podcasting, there''s no central index. Distribution is decentralized, with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Amazon, Podcast Index, Listen Notes, and others keeping each other in check. This prevents any one entity from dominating the ecosystem and charging podcasters to "boost" content to their listeners.</p><p>Some might argue that having multiple podcast indexes is a weakness, but protocols like DNS have shown us that all that replicating indexes can lead to a more resilient system.</p><h2>Protecting the Open Podcast Ecosystem&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite the merits of open standards, RSS in podcasting has its critics.</p><p>In his&nbsp;<a href="https://mignano.medium.com/the-standards-innovation-paradox-e14cab521391">essay</a>, Michael Mignano, the founder of Anchor (now acquired by Spotify), argues that podcasting needs a proprietary (closed) system. In a subsequent <a href="https://weekly.podnews.net/1538779/8027993">interview on Podland</a>, he describes what he calls "The Standards/Innovation Paradox:"</p><blockquote><p>"The paradox is: when a standard [like RSS] breaks through and gains massive adoption it then becomes very, very hard to change. And the market that it effectively powers stagnates in terms of innovation, because nobody can come to an agreement about what the changes to the standards should be at scale."</p></blockquote><h3>The Reliability of Open Standards Enables Innovation</h3><p>Mignano argues that without centralized control, innovation will stagnate because open standards are "very, very hard to change." <b>However, this stability also enables innovation.</b> For example:</p><ol><li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong>: HTTP enables communication between web clients and servers. Without this foundational standard, none of the modern web-based applications we use daily would be possible: Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, and Instagram.</li><li><strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</strong>: This is the fundamental way devices communicate and transfer data on the Internet. It has enabled technologies like VoIP (Voice over IP) services such as Zoom, livestreaming on YouTube, and online gaming.</li><li><strong>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)</strong>: This open-source project enables developers to add real-time communication capabilities (like video and voice) to their applications. It''s foundational for products like Discord, Google Voice, and Twitter Spaces.</li></ol><h3>Open Standards Generate Opportunities for Small Companies</h3><p>Best of all, open standards don''t just benefit big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon; they also provide opportunities for small, independent companies to build new compelling products:</p><ul><li><a href="https://convertkit.com/?lmref=erdpyA">ConvertKit</a>&nbsp;is a self-funded email newsletter startup built on SMTP.</li><li><a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a>, a new email app from 37signals that competes with larger products from Google like Gmail.</li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a> (the company I co-founded) hosts podcasts, generates feeds, and distributes audio to listeners.</li></ul><p><a href="https://mignano.medium.com/the-standards-innovation-paradox-e14cab521391">In his essay</a> introduction, Michael Mignano says:</p><blockquote><p>Despite the benefit of standards-based products being able to reach an audience faster, the tradeoff is that a lower barrier to entry means more products get created in a category, causing market fragmentation and ultimately, a slow pace of innovation.</p></blockquote><p>How is enabling more indie products and competition in a category bad?</p><p>Mignano is casting "market fragmentation" as a negative. But let''s look at it from another angle: "Market fragmentation" means that a market has a diverse group of products, with no single product exerting monopolistic control.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this&nbsp;is another benefit of open standards: resistance to monopolies. Although large companies may dominate certain areas (like Gmail for email and Apple Podcasts for podcast listening), the open nature of the protocols still allows smaller companies to compete in meaningful ways (Hey for email, Overcast for podcast listening).</p><p>I''d argue that any ''innovation'' built inside a centralized, proprietary platform isn''t true innovation. Why? Because any benefits will be hoarded inside the company that owns the platform. Compare that with the beauty of open protocols that spread benefits across a wide community of individuals and organizations. But with proprietary systems, all the perks and upside go to winner-take-all monopolies and their shareholders.</p><h2>True Innovation in Podcasting</h2><p>The beauty of RSS lies in its extensibility, as demonstrated by Apple when it added&nbsp;<code>&lt;itunes&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags, enabling podcast cover art, chapters, and more. Today, Google, Apple, and Spotify have all added their tags to the RSS namespace. The Podcasting 2.0 group is moving fast, adding new&nbsp;<code>&lt;podcast&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags, including the ability to add transcripts.</p><p>There''s room for innovation on top of RSS.</p><p>This is the goal of the new <a href="https://podstandards.org/">Podcast Standards</a> organization: to petition hosting platforms and listening apps to adopt a standard set of new podcasting tags and features. It''s the podcast equivalent of the <a href="https://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a>, which successfully rallied different companies to support open standards set by the W3C.</p><p>Multiple podcast hosting platforms and listening apps have already added new features introduced by the <a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace">Podcasting 2.0</a> project. These include:</p><p>They''re innovating on top of RSS with support for chapters, funding, people profiles, transcripts, and more.</p><h2>Podcasting is Better When it''s Open</h2><p>True innovation isn''t born within the confines of proprietary systems. It''s nurtured in the open, shared amongst a community, benefiting everyone—not just a select few.</p><p>The beauty of RSS is that it''s simple, extendible, and already distributed. Projects like Podcasting 2.0 have shown you can innovate on top of RSS (with their new &lt;podcast&gt; tags). Grassroots organizations like Podcast Standards are rallying different companies to support new tags and features that extend the RSS spec.</p><p>The future of innovation lies in openness, in diversity, and in shared benefits. As we stand on the brink of a new era, it''s time for us to decide which side we''re on: the side that seeks to monopolize and control or the side that champions open protocols, innovation, and shared benefits.&nbsp;</p>'
