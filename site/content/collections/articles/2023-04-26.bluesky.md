    text: '<h2>How do I get an invite code for Bluesky?</h2><p>Apparently, <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky''s waitlist</a>&nbsp;has over one million+ people on it. The team is slowly rolling out invites to 1,000 people per week.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, this isn''t to create FOMO or drive interest. Emily (on the Bluesky team) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emily.bsky.team/post/3ju7ubhkakk2t">recently posted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We mainly require invite codes bc we want to finish our moderation/curation tooling before we really open this to everyone. weâ€™re trusting that the people you invite will likewise respect our community guidelines</p></blockquote><p>The quickest way to get an invite is to find an individual user with invite codes. Each user gets one invite code for every two weeks they''re on the app.&nbsp;<br></p>'
