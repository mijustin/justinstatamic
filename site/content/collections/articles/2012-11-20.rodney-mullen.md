    text: '<p>But he''s also an entrepreneur. He helped found World Industries and Dwindle Distribution. In 2002, he and his partners sold their company to Globe Shoes for $46 million dollars.</p><p>I''ve been following Rodney for a long time, and I think he''s got lots of good advice for bootstrappers and startup folks.</p><p>Here are some of my favorite lessons I''ve learned from him.</p><h3>On winning</h3><p>For years, Rodney was winning every contest he entered. But once he was at the top it didn''t feel like winning anymore. He was just defending his position as a champion. And when he became defensive, it was hard to create.</p><p>He describes this in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwjlDBjNzXk&amp;feature=youtu.be">Ted Talk</a>&nbsp;(at 16:22):</p><blockquote><p>Over 11 years, I won 35 out of 36 contests. Wait, "winning" isn''t the right word.&nbsp;<i>I only won once. The rest of the time I was just defending.</i></p></blockquote><p>This has an interesting application to tech companies: many of us are trying to be #1 in our industry. <strong>We don''t realize how hard it is at the top.</strong>&nbsp;Everyone has their sights on you. You are the incumbent that everyone wants to beat. And instead of innovating, you spend your time playing defence.<br></p><h3>On reinventing yourself</h3><p>Freestyle skateboarding died in the 1980''s when street skating emerged as the dominant style. Everything Rodney had built over his lifetime, all his fame, was gone.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Suddenly it was over for me. They took my pro-model off the shelf: that''s like publicly pronouncing that your [career] is dead. The crazy thing was that there was a really liberating sense about it: because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion. What drew me to skateboarding, the freedom, was restored. Now I could just create things.</p><p>- Rodney Mullen, Timecode: 3:46</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>This couldn''t be more true for us in tech! We are continually having to re-invent ourselves. You might spend your whole career focusing on a certain technology (maybe you''ve even become a pseudo "celebrity") only to wake up one morning to discover you are no longer relevant. I love Mullen''s attitude here: instead of just giving up, you reinvent yourself using whatever you can carryover from past experiences.</p><blockquote><p>What I did have was a deep well of tricks that I could draw from that were rooted in [my old skills]. So as humbling and rotten as it wasâ€¦ I began over again. I brought [new] tricks to [street skating] that were undergirded in freestyle. I had an infrastructure [to build on].</p><p>- Rodney Mullen, Timecode: 4:40</p></blockquote><h3><br></h3><h3>On creative communities</h3><p>One of the most interesting moments occurs when he refers to hacker and open source communities. He then reveals a parallel between them and the skateboard community:</p><blockquote><p>We take what other guys do, and we make it our own, and then we contribute back to the community in a way that edifies the community. The summation of that gives us something that we could never achieve as an individual.</p><p>- Rodney Mullen, Timecode: 11:50</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>The parallel here is interesting. The tech culture is filled with a strong individualism, and yet we''ve managed to create vibrant communities where individuals contribute to a greater whole. Rodney closes his talk by stating that contributing to his community has been his life''s most meaningful achievement.</p><h3>Watch the whole talk</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Learn how to hack your office:subscribe to my mailing list.</h3><p>Email: </p><p>First Name: </p><p>Last Name: </p><p><br></p><p><em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4814766">Discuss this post on Hacker News</a></em></p>'
