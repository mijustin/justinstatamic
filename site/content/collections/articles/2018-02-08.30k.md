      <p>It was 10pm on a Friday night. I was sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop open.</p>
      <p>I was watching hundreds of Stripe payment notifications come through:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1762" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/annual.jpg" alt="Stripe payment notifications in macOs menu bar via CashNotify" width="719" height="317" /></p>
      <p>Thousands of dollars were pouring into my account.</p>
      <p>And I was miserable.</p>
      <p>A year previous, I'd launched a new subscription product called <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>.</p>
      <p>People loved it. I'd received tons of <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/reviews/">good reviews</a>.</p>
      <p>But now it was renewal time. And I started getting emails:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Due to circumstances, I wasn't able to take full advantage of TMW last year. This year, I have laid out plans to go from working "in" my business to actually changing things around and making progress. But I haven't finished last year's courses. Do I really need to pay again?</p></blockquote>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Also common:</span></p>
      <blockquote><p>Sorry, Justin, I had forgotten this was a yearly subscription. I'm happy with the current version, but I'm only 50% finished. Could you refund this second payment?</p></blockquote>
      <p>As more emails came in, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach: "this isn't working."</p>
      <h3>What went wrong?</h3>
      <p>Tiny Wins started as a free 14-day drip email sequence. Every day, I'd send you a new marketing tip.</p>
      <p><a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/75552"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1763" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/convertkit-sequence-1024x418.png" alt="A 14 day ConvertKit drip campaign sequence" width="600" height="245" /></a></p>
      <p>It launched on Product Hunt on Oct 29, 2015. Nearly four thousand people signed up.</p>
      <p>Wow.</p>
      <p>After the 14 days was over, people asked me if I was going to keep doing it.</p>
      <p>"The only way I'd be able to keep doing it is if it was a paid subscription," I said.</p>
      <p><strong>"We'll pay!" my subscribers said.</strong></p>
      <p>I sat on the idea for awhile but finally launched a paid subscription in February 2017.</p>
      <p>True to form, hundreds of people paid $249 for a year's subscription.</p>
      <p>I started sending them weekly marketing tutorial (video + pdf), and they tracked their progress inside the app:</p>
      <p><a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1764" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/origin-tiny-marketing-wins-2017-1024x485.jpg" alt="Original Tiny Marketing Wins dashboard in 2017" width="600" height="284" /></a></p>
      <h3>User feedback + iteration</h3>
      <p>In the first few months, I noticed that people were completing the tactics much slower than I'd anticipated:</p>
      <p><a href="https://wpcomplete.co/?ref=9"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1769" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/completion-rates-1024x400.png" alt="WPComplete completion rates" width="600" height="234" /></a></p>
      <p>I started talking to my users and doing surveys. The results proved my suspicion:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1766" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/initial-tweet.png" alt="Survey results: &quot;show me how to create a Facebook ad,&quot; &quot;help me implement basic SEO,&quot; &quot;train me on Google Analytics&quot;" width="475" height="267" /></p>
      <p>So, I tweaked the product to be focused on functional categories. I improved the dashboard as well:</p>
      <p><a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/tactics/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1767" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-website-tactics-1024x571.png" alt="Tiny Marketing Wins dashboard shows you your progress" width="600" height="335" /></a></p>
      <p>The feedback from users was good:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1768" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/caroline-zook-facebook-ads-500x220.png" alt="Caroline Zook feedback on the Facebook Ads course" width="500" height="220" /></p>
      <p>People liked the new format. It also helped me (as the creator) think about specific outcomes my users needed, and respond to those directly.</p>
      <p>But that still left a big question...</p>
      <h3>What about the business model?</h3>
      <p>The original idea with Tiny Wins is that I'd send users a new marketing tactic every seven days. That meant recording a new video tutorial and creating the handbook PDF, every week.</p>
      <p>As 2017 came to an end, I took another look at individual completion rates:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1765" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tiny-marketing-wins-wpcomplete-1024x297.png" alt="WPComplete showed me course completion rates inside of WordPress" width="600" height="174" /></p>
      <p>In retrospect, this makes sense. What solopreneur has time to implement a new marketing tactic every week?</p>
      <p>As I was pondering all of this, the annual renewals I was referring to earlier started coming through.</p>
      <p>My stomach started to sink.</p>
      <p>Once I started receiving refund requests, I knew: this wasn't going to work as a subscription service.</p>
      <p>I had to make a decision.</p>
      <p>So, that Friday night, I manually refunded hundreds of payments. <strong>In total, I refunded about $30,000.</strong></p>
      <p>I emailed users to tell them I was canceling all annual renewals. They'd still be able to access the content, and I was going to think about my next steps.</p>
      <h3>Right product, wrong business model</h3>
      <p>Sending that email, and refunding all those charges, was one of the hardest things I had to do.</p>
      <p>But, I started hearing from customers right away:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cancel-encouragement.png" alt="A cancelled user sends encouragement" width="696" height="266" /></p>
      <p>Customers liked the product; they didn't like the business model.</p>
      <p>I wrote about this threat <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/saas/">back in 2016</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Many founders choose SaaS just because you want the recurring revenue. But just because you like the model as a founder, doesn’t mean it’s the right model for your customers, your product, your niche, or the current market conditions!</p></blockquote>
      <p>In this case, my customers were used to paying <strong>once</strong> for online courses. But here, they had to pay annually, and once their plan expired, they no longer had access.</p>
      <h3>Pivoting to lifetime access</h3>
      <p>After listening to customer feedback, I decided to try a new business model:</p>
      <blockquote><p><em>"Tiny Marketing Wins is an awesome list of marketing tutorials. And now, you pay once for lifetime access."</em></p></blockquote>
      <p>I sent out the announcement email. Here's what I heard back:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1771 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/response1.png" alt="&quot;Awww yeah! Great decision&quot;" width="722" height="107" /></p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1772 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/response2.png" alt="&quot;Love it! Tiny Marketing Wins is epic!&quot;" width="721" height="84" /></p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1773 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/response3.png" alt="&quot;Great to see Tiny Wins back again&quot;" width="718" height="111" /></p>
      <p>Already, 102 people have registered for <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/register/">lifetime access</a>.</p>
      <p>It cost me $30,000 in refunds, but I feel like I may have cracked product-market fit. My plan now is to slowly add new tactics (probably 1-2 a month) to the list.</p>
      <p>Currently, folks have two choices:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>They can buy my Tiny Wins courses <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/">individually</a> (currently $600+ in total)</li>
      <li>They can get lifetime access to Tiny Wins for under $300.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">check out the new Tiny Marketing Wins here</a>. Until Feb 28, 2018, get $50 off lifetime access with the code <code>relaunch</code>.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
