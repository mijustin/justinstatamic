      <p>My commute takes a total of 2.5 hours a day.  I'm making good use of the time by taking the bus, and working on the road, but it's still a long time to be <em>driving.</em> I do work from home one day a week, but I still haven't found the perfect "home office environment;" until now.</p>
      <p>A company called <a href="http://www.officepod.co.uk/">OfficePOD</a> is building beautiful, self-contained "work pods" that you can stick in your backyard.  It's time to skip the commute.</p>
