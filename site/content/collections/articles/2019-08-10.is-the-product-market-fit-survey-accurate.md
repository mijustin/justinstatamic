I''m also a member of a handful of other communities and groups that use Slack.</p><p>When I initially started using Slack, I loved it. The interface felt playful. It was easy to start a new group based on a shared interest.</p><p>But now, like many others, I''ve grown weary of it.</p><p>My weariness isn''t enough to make me stop using it, but it''s made me wonder: how disappointed would I be, really, if it went away?</p><h2>The Product/Market Fit Survey</h2><p>To determine whether Dropbox had product/market fit, Sean Ellis used this same question ("How would you feel if you could no longer use Dropbox?").</p><p>He gave respondents four choices:</p><ul><li>Very disappointed</li><li>Somewhat disappointed</li><li>Not disappointed (it really isn''t that useful)</li><li>N/A (I no longer use the product)</li></ul><p>His benchmark for product/market fit was if 40% (or more) of respondents replied that they would be "very disappointed if they could no longer use the product."</p><p>He later admitted that "this threshold is a bit arbitrary, but I defined it after comparing results across nearly 100 startups. Those that struggle for traction are always under 40%, while most that gain strong traction exceed 40%.‚Äù</p><p>I''ve personally used this survey, for different startups I''ve worked with. I''ve also recommended it <a href="https://youtu.be/C-Kv6V2etc8">here</a>, in the past:</p>'

    text: '<p>The survey seems especially helpful for early-stage products.</p><p>But, as I observed above, the results might not be as useful for more mature products.</p><h3>Limitations of the Product/Market Fit Survey</h3><p>The survey has other limitations, that product people should be aware of.</p><p>First, it asks customers to guess about their future feelings.</p><p>As Rob Fitzpatrick points out in <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">his book</a>, their answers could lead you down the wrong path. He points out that humans are generally bad at forecasting their future behavior.</p><p>When a customer responds to your product survey and says they''d be "very dissapointed" if your product went away, they''re guessing. In the future, if your product does go away, they might find that it doesn''t actually bug them that much!</p><p><br></p><p>Instead, he advocates for this approach:</p><blockquote><p>"Ask about what they already do now, not what they believe they might do in the future."</p></blockquote>'
