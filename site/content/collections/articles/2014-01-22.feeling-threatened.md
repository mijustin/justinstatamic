      <p>Watching how a company, industry, or individual responds to a threat tells you a lot about how much they understand the needs of their customers.</p>
      <p>Recently, Squarespace announced <a href="http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/introducing-squarespace-logo">a new feature</a> that allows users to self-create their own logo, online, with simple tools.</p>
      <p>The announcement generated criticism from professional designers:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Hey Squarespace: Impressive how eager you are to destroy your standing with graphic designers. I have to ask how this is a good idea."<br />
      - <a href="https://twitter.com/irrg/status/426068843749195777">Source</a></p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>"This really bothers me. These guys should know better than to devalue what others in the same industry do for a living."<br />
      - <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/13487-squarespace-announces-new-logo-builder">Source</a></p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><p>"At first I kind of thought everyone was overreacting about #squarespacelogo until I saw how much of a mockery it makes of my profession."<br />

      <p>It's natural to feel defensive when something threatens your livelihood. I understand that; it's scary to think about.</p>
      <p><strong>But we really need to look at things from the customer's perspective:</strong> the customer doesn't really care about the design industry, it's ideology, or it's problems. They only care about their own problems.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, if the customer finds a different approach to solve a problem (like Squarespace Logo), and it gives them the outcome they want, it doesnâ€™t matter how we feel.</p>
      <p>Really, the key to being successful is to eschew your own self-focus in order to stay <em>hyper-focused</em> on what the customer needs. <strong>If you're good at finding (and solving) pain you'll always be in business.</strong></p>
      <p>Squarespace originally built their brand by disrupting two industries: web development and web hosting. Instead of spending thousands of dollars hiring a web developer, a customer can create (and host) their website using self-serve tools, starting at <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/">$8/month</a>.</p>
      <p>Now they're doing it again with logo design. Maybe the people who use these cheap, self-serve logos will experience adverse effects: maybe they'll lose business, or lose the respect of their customers.</p>
      <p>Or maybe... they won't. Maybe these new Squarespace logos will fit their needs perfectly. Ultimately, that's up to the customer to decide. If they like the results they're getting from cheap self-made logos, they'll keep using them.</p>
      <p>If you're going to rally paying customers around your cause, <strong>you have to show them what's in it for them</strong>. You're going to need to show them data: "a professionally designed logo will improve your brand's perception by 150%", "according to this study, a well designed logo increases the pride felt by employees", or "a designer can save you money, by providing an identity that can live for decades."</p>
      <p>But instead of focusing on the customer, and where you might be able to offer more value, I hear rallying cries that come off as defensive and self-focused:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"<a title="Business lesson: Go where the people are" href="http://justinjackson.ca/business-lesson-go-where-the-people-are/">Shop local!</a>"<br />
      "Don't outsource programming work overseas."<br />
      "Hire a <em>real</em> designer to create your logo."</p></blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, the customer is staring back at you and asking: "Why? What's in it for me?"</p>
      <p>I think we, as designers, developers, and business people, can ward off most threats by getting to know our customers intimately - and finding places where we can offer legitimate value. No self-defence necessary.</p>
      <p>Regards,<br />
