      <p>I'm a big fan of Hugh MacLeod’s <a href="http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/6.HowToBeCreative">sex and cash theory</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs. One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills.”</p></blockquote>
      </div>
      <div>This is true in almost every industry:</div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>If you're a photographer, you can look for the "sexy" job of shooting art photos (cool job, but not high paying), or you can shoot weddings (drag job, but lucrative)</li>
      <li>If you're into food, you could start your own restaurant (high risk but sexy, potentially low paying), or you could get a management job at <a href="http://www.sysco.ca/canada/">Sysco</a>.</li>
      <li>If you're a graphic designer, you can design band posters or you can design brochures for a bank.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Are you a creative person looking to make a living?  It's OK to do cool projects in your spare time; but when it comes to making money, start thinking differently.  <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2904-forget-passion-focus-on-process">Matt Linderman says</a>: "Instead of working with <em>a thing</em> you love, think about how to work in <em>a way</em> you love."</p>
