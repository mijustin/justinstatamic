    text: '<p>We sold skateboard decks, snowboards, clothing, and accessories.</p><p>We cared about our customers. Our store was well designed. We stocked the best brands. Plus, we had a point of view: "It''s better to shop locally."<br></p><p><b>But our potential customers didn''t care about any of that.</b></p><p>We''d aligned our shop around a concept that didn''t resonate with the consumer.</p><p>They already had a solution that was working for them: they drove to the big city (about 35 minutes away). They would go on a Saturday and visit multiple shops. These stores had a bigger selection than we could ever have. Additionally, in the early 2000s, internet shopping was becoming a thing. Kids were discovering they could get the same product, for less, online.<br></p><p><strong>Once we discovered this, we tried to change their behavior.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>We launched "shop local" campaigns, and tried to offer competitive pricing. We also sponsored local athletes, put on shows, and even started a magazine.</p><p>But ultimately, none of that mattered. Customers were already in motion, and all our thrashing couldn''t change that.</p><h2>Humans do what''s easiest</h2><p>There''s a popular design meme that shows a paved pathway (what the designer envisioned), and the reality (a shortcut path next to it, worn into the grass).</p>'

    text: '<p>Many entrepreneurs start their business because they have a vision for "the way things should be."</p><p>That''s admirable! It''s what''s driving Elon Musk, and Tesla, to get more electric cars on the road. But customers don''t always care about your vision. Sometimes, they just want a fast, high-tech sports car, because their friends are all driving them.</p><blockquote><p>"Like nearly everyone who loves technology, I’ve wanted to buy a Tesla for years." – Nathan Barry</p></blockquote><p>We tend to align our actions with what our peers are doing, as Seth Godin puts it here:</p><blockquote><p>"People like us do things like this."</p></blockquote><p>All of this is to say: it''s incredibly difficult to change human behavior. We''re creatures of habit. We do what we''ve always done, or what others are doing.</p><p>Customers don''t care about your ideology. To succeed, your beliefs about "the way things should be" need to line up with what your customers desire.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
