    text: '<p>According to <a href="http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/be-my-hive-brain/">his blog</a>, Graham Linehan has just delivered the finale episode for season 3 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd">The IT Crowd</a>, probably the funniest sitcom ever made.</p><p>Right now, he''s looking for prop suggestions for this season''s IT office.  You can email them to: ben.capel@talkbackthames.tv.</p><p>Now remember, I''m talking about the UK version of the show.  NBC had tried to bring it over to North America last year (and stole one of the best characters, Moss, from the British version), but apparently, that''s all over now.  The British show is back, which is good.</p><p>You can purchase the first two seasons on DVD, or if you''re so inclined, find them floating around the net. </p>'
