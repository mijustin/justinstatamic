    text: '<p>When I sit down to do these year-in-review posts, the hardest part is figuring out how open I can be. I believe vulnerability is crucial for good writing, but there''s definitely a limit on how many layers deep I can go in public.</p><p>Here, I''ll do my best to share my experience of 2021, but keep in mind that it''s all fairly close to the surface. It''s a representation of my year, but a fairly flat one.</p>'

    text: '<p><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/4e2424aa">At the beginning of the year</a>, I think my co-founder (Jon) and I were both feeling weary from the pandemic and American politics. As a two person company, we decided to be gentle with ourselves. Instead of trying to "kill it," we focused on self-care for the first few months. Despite all that, we ended up shipping some significant features <a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/private-podcast-email/">for private podcasting</a> in the first quarter.</p><p>We made two big hiring moves in 2021: in April we hired <a href="https://transistor.fm/helen/">Helen full-time</a> (as Head of Customer Success), and in August <a href="https://transistor.fm/jason/">we hired Jason</a>&nbsp;(a full-time Senior Rails Developer). Jon and I both agree: these hires were the best part of the year. Transistor is now a team of four people!</p>'

    text: '<p>The biggest feature we released in 2021 was&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/midroll/">Dynamic Audio Insertion</a>. This allows podcasters to automatically insert an audio ad, or announcement, at the beginning, middle,&nbsp;or end of every episode in your feed. Some of our competitors (like Spotify''s&nbsp;<a href="https://megaphone.fm/">Megaphone</a>) charge a lot of money for these features, so we''re excited to make it accessible to our customers at a lower price-point.</p><p>In terms of revenue, we grew just over 31% in 2021.</p>'

    text: '<p>Jon and I feel immensely fortunate that the company has done as well as it has. It''s enabled us to pay ourselves well, and to be generous with our team. We''ve also been able to make significant contributions to <a href="https://transistor.fm/climate-change/">Stripe''s Climate program</a>, the <a href="https://rainforestfoundation.org/donate/?segmentCode=TWSH21SM">Rainforest Foundation</a>, and a handful of other causes.</p><p>One goal Jon and I had for 2021, that we didn''t achieve, was for us to see meet up in person. As remote cofounders, our annual retreats are a big deal for us; it helps us&nbsp;feel connected. It was really sad for both of us not to hang out together. He has a trip to Canada booked in January 2022; fingers crossed it happens!<br></p><h2>What happened in 2021 (personal)</h2><p>The first quarter of 2021 felt like a continuation of 2020. We were still living in our bubble due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>I continue to be incredibly thankful for our local mountain, <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/">Silverstar</a>. We spent much of January, February, and March skiing and snowboarding there. The mountains are good for the soul; especially during a pandemic.</p><p>In January, my wife finished a big pandemic project: a redesign of the <a href="https://coworkvernon.com/">coworking office</a> that I run with a few locals. Her and her friend did an incredible job.</p>'

    text: '<p>I found a new therapist in January (my previous therapist had moved away). I''ve been going monthly and feel like I''ve had some major breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting in January, I started playing piano and guitar again. I''m not incredibly good at either, but I found something meditative about plunking on piano keys, or strumming the same three chords on guitar. It''s a practice I''ve continued until now: strum, strum, plink, plunk, breathe, empty my mind.</p><p>The <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/07/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf">attack on the Capitol</a> in the USA made me angry and sad.</p><p>Judging from my <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1355523396876963841">tweets</a>, and accidental screenshots on my phone, I spent a fair amount of time exploring <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> at the beginning of the year. By the end of the year, most of the excitement surrounding Clubhouse had waned.</p><p>We really had the most glorious spring in 2021. Everything felt alive, lush, fresh, colorful.</p>'

I got my first dose (AstraZeneca) in May.</p><p>We still weren''t able to travel widely, but spring in Vernon was warm, and we got outside a ton. Everything felt picturesque.</p>'

The first was a trip to Canmore and Banff where we met up with my sister, her husband, my three nieces, and my baby nephew that I''d never met. After being away from each other for the whole pandemic it was life-giving to be together again.<br></p>'

For most of July and August we lived under a fiery red sky, filled toxic smoke and ash. It was truly awful. We couldn''t go outside, and the air quality was some of the worst in the world (AQI hit 500+ on many days).</p>'
