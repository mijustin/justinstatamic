    text: '<p>Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter, and make it a private company. In his <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418091/000110465922045641/tm2212748d1_sc13da.htm">SEC filing</a>, he said:</p><blockquote><p>I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.</p></blockquote><p>It''s important to get this framing right: Elon doesn''t want to acquire Twitter to make it more profitable, or increase revenue. He is explicitly trying to privatize it because he believes he can&nbsp;</p><p>I realize billionaires currently have the right to purchase media/social media companies.</p><p>What bothers me is his belief (widely believed by his followers) that Elon taking over Twitter would be a "win for free speech."<br><br>Free speech is a social construct, which has been encoded into law in different&nbsp;jurisdictions.<br>There''s nothing about Elon taking over Twitter that would change how free speech is governed in the USA.<br><br>As a private-sector company, under USA law, Twitter has the right to moderate content, block users, etc:<br><br></p><blockquote><p>The First Amendment of the US Constitution limits the government—not private entities—from restricting free expression. This is why companies like Facebook and Twitter can moderate content—and also why they could suspend then-President Trump’s accounts during his last weeks in office. (<a href="https://daily.jstor.org/is-there-a-first-amendment-right-to-tweet/">Jstor</a>)</p></blockquote><p><br>It was, in fact, a Republican president who made this rule explicit:<br><br></p><blockquote><p>Only after President Richard Nixon appointed four pro-business conservative justices did the Supreme Court reject this view of the First Amendment, and insist that private corporations have no constitutional obligation to grant access to their property to speakers they dislike, no matter how powerful those corporations might be.</p></blockquote><p><br>(<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/first-amendment-regulation/617827/">Ref</a>)<br><br>If Elon is truly concerned about how free speech laws are applied in the USA, he should be petitioning for a change to the laws. For example, in the EU, free speech legislation is applied differently:<br></p><blockquote><p>The US approach is to keep the government out of it as much as possible. The EU approach is to ask for government enforcement. [The EU''s proposed legislation], the DSA, also allows users to challenge takedown decisions and encourages transparency about content moderation decisions. European governments would not only tell companies what they must remove, but also what they must not remove.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br>(<a href="https://daily.jstor.org/is-there-a-first-amendment-right-to-tweet/">Jstor</a>)<br><br>Currently, the only legal way to truly make Twitter a "platform for free speech" is if the &lt;gulp&gt; USA government made it a&nbsp;part of the commons (in the same way you can speak freely on a street corner).<br><br>Nothing Musk is proposing would change how Twitter currently relates to free speech laws in the USA.<br><br>This is just a chance for Musk to impose his personal preferences/ideology on how content is moderated. That''s not "improving free speech."<br><br>His rhetoric that he will enable "more free speech" is a misnomer.<br>In the USA, you already have the legal principle of free speech, and Twitter is acting within those boundaries.<br>So yes: Elon has the right to buy Twitter (in the same way that other billionaires can buy media properties). If he does buy it, he is (under the current legal framework) allowed to enforce his personal concept of what "free speech" looks like.<br>But that will not be a win for "free speech," it''s just a win for folks who see the world the way Elon does. That''s an entirely different thing.</p>'
