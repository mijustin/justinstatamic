YouTube has started giving folks a short animated preview of what they can expect. Plus, once someone clicks through on a video, those first few seconds will determine if they stay and watch, or if they bounce.</p><p>I re-edited <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1486415798310637570">my intro</a> a few times, adding background music, a title screen, and preview scenes to give folks a sense of what to expect later in the video. I asked the <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> Slack for their feedback:</p>'
