It''s purpose is to share our journey, and help other founders navigate the startup stage.</p><h2>Next, do your research</h2><p>It''s not enough to pick a topic. To really stand out, you''ll need to ask yourself:</p><blockquote>What unique perspective can I bring to this subject? What hasn''t been done before? How can I stand out?</blockquote><p>A good tool for doing podcast research is <a href="https://chartable.com/">Chartable</a>.</p><p>You can use it to browse the different podcast categories, and see what types of shows are ranking highly.</p><p>When you see a show at the top of a category,&nbsp; look and see when it was last updated. If it''s been months (or years!) you might be able to create a new show to fill that space.</p>'

      </ul><h2>Record&nbsp;a practice&nbsp;podcast</h2><p>It's not time to run out and get a bunch of recording gear (yet).</p><blockquote><p>Before you run out and buy a bunch of gear, record something now! You don’t need a fancy mic to start practicing.</p></blockquote><p>The next step is to record a test episode with whatever recording device you currently own. For most <g class="gr_ gr_122 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="122" data-gr-id="122">people</g> this is their iPhone or Android device.</p><p>It's really as easy as this:</p><ol>
      <li>Find the Voice Memos app on your iPhone</li>
      <li>Choose a topic you’d like to talk about</li>
      <li>Write out an outline for a short 5-10 minute episode</li>
      <li>Open up the Voice Memos app and record your episode!</li>
      <li>Repeat over and over again: practice recording that same episode dozens of times</li>
      </ol><p>The idea is to start small. A lot of people fall into the trap of wanting all the <g class="gr_ gr_134 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="134" data-gr-id="134">gear,</g> because buying equipment is fun. It makes you feel like you've already arrived. But podcasting is about creating compelling audio narratives, and you can do that without expensive gear. If you've never recorded your voice before, why would you spend a bunch of money?</p><p>For more on practicing podcasting,&nbsp;take a look at:</p><ul>

      </ul><h2>Get the podcasting gear starter kit</h2><p>After doing a lot of research, and getting some great advice from my friend <a href="http://avclark.com">Adam Clark</a>, here's what I recommend for people starting out:</p><ol>
      <li><strong>Microphone</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004QJOZS4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B004QJOZS4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justjackblog-20">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a></li>
      <li><strong>Pop filter:&nbsp;</strong>Find one that will work with your mic. <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00D78W20I/ref=pe_386430_126088100_TE_item">This one is a good start</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Headphones</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003LPTAYI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B003LPTAYI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justjackblog-20">Sennheiser HD 202 II</a></li>
      <li><strong>Editing software</strong>: <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/mac/garageband/">Garage Band</a> (for Mac) and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> (for PC)</li>
      </ol><p>That whole set-up should cost you under $100 USD.</p><p><g class="gr_ gr_128 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="128" data-gr-id="128">Here's</g> a few other gear guides:</p><ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.podcastmethod.co/podcasting-equipment-guide/">Dan Benjamin's podcast equipment guide</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/3/">Podcasting gear</a> (audio)</li>
      </ul><h2>Podcast hosting</h2><p>For hosting you'll need two things:</p><ol>
      <li>A&nbsp;website (homepage) for your podcast and the RSS feed</li>
      <li>A place to host your audio files</li>
      </ol><p>Initially, for my first podcast, I hosted the website + feed on <g class="gr_ gr_130 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="130" data-gr-id="130">WordPress,</g> and the files on Amazon S3. (If you use WordPress, use the <a href="http://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/">PowerPress plugin</a> to create an iTunes ready feed).</p><p>Nowadays, I recommend people use <a href="https://transistor.fm/?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=jjlinks">Transistor.fm</a>. They'll do it all for you: provide you with a website, MP3 hosting, an iTunes ready RSS feed, and great stats.</p><h2>Recording, interviewing, editing your podcast</h2><p>A lot of podcasts are interview shows over Skype. To record the audio, you can use <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/"><g class="gr_ gr_115 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="115" data-gr-id="115">Skype</g> Call Recorder</a> or <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a>. I also use <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a>, which is screencasting software, but it works really well for recording audio as well.</p><p>When you're looking to book guests, send people genuine emails that show you know who they are, and what they're passionate about. Also, use <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> so they can choose a time that works best for them.</p><p>Where do you get theme music? You can get theme music from <a href="http://www.premiumbeat.com/">Premium Beat</a> and <a href="http://audiojungle.net/">Audio Jungle</a>. I got my music from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hiphopbeatsforsalenow.com/?utm_source=justinjackson">someone local</a>&nbsp;here in Vernon, BC.</p><p><em>I talk more about getting guests in <a href="http://signaltower.co/justin-jackson/">my interview here</a>.</em></p><h2>How to launch and promote your podcast on iTunes</h2><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1173 size-large" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how-to-submit-your-podcast-to-itunes-justin-jackson-1024x532.png" alt="How to submit your podcast to itunes" width="1000" height="520"></p><p>The most important channel for your podcast will be iTunes.
