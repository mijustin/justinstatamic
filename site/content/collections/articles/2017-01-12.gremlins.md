      <p>Do you ever get mind gremlins?</p>
      <p>They're the nagging worries in the back of your mind.</p>
      <p>We get them about tech stuff:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Do I have Google Analytics configured properly? Is it reporting correctly?"</p></blockquote>
      <p>We get them about marketing stuff:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Should I be posting on Medium? Am I missing out on a good channel?"</p></blockquote>
      <p>If you're a product person, you should pay attention to the kinds of things that make people anxious.</p>
      <h3>Building a new product?</h3>
      <p>A recurring worry that's felt by a lot of people can be the seed for a new product idea.</p>
      <p>For example, <a href="https://intercom.com">Intercom</a> created a product that taps into a common business owner anxiety:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"How many people are visiting my site, not getting the answer they want, and leaving forever?</p></blockquote>
      <p>They solved this problem by introducing a chat widget that allows an owner to be available for questions from website visitors.</p>
      <p>Business owners love it. They start using it and instantly see results (sales go up). Also: their stress goes away!</p>
      <p>(BTW – I'm using this exact process to build <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/?convertkit=true">my new product</a>).</p>
      <h3>Have an established product?</h3>
      <p>Your customers get mind gremlins about your product too. For example, I've heard from some Stripe customers who wonder:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Am I overpaying for credit card processing? Is there a better rate out there?"</p></blockquote>
      <p>Identifying and alleviating these worries can proactively help you fight churn.</p>
      <p>Stripe could, for example, send an email to their customers that says:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"You'll always get the lowest rate with us, guaranteed."</p></blockquote>
      <p>The most dangerous mind gremlin a customer can have is this one:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Am I still getting value from this product? Should I keep paying for it?"</p></blockquote>
      <p>Your challenge, as the product owner, is identifying those people <em data-redactor-tag="em">before </em>they leave.</p>
      <p>One method for identifying potential problems is sending your customers the Product / Market Fit Survey.</p>
      <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
      <div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//C-Kv6V2etc8?rel=0" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
      <p>(if you're interested in that, I just made <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/sample-pm-fit/">this tutorial + worksheet free</a>)</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Here's a good practice to get into: create a note called "Mind Gremlins" and update it whenever:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You notice yourself having an anxious thought</li>
      <li>You overhear another person having an anxious thought</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is what mine looks like:</p>

      <p>I hope this is helpful!</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />

      <p>PS: are you anxious about stuff like <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/search-console/">"Am I using Google Webmaster Tools correctly?"</a></p>
      <p>These are <em data-redactor-tag="em">exactly</em> the kind of gremlins I'm trying to solve with my new subscription service <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/?convertkit=true">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>.</p>
      <p>Launch is planned for Feb 1st, 2017!</p>
