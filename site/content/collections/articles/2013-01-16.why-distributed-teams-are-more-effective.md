      <p>Apparently, venture capitalist Mark Suster <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/07/05/the-power-of-in-person-why-distributed-teams-are-less-effective/">doesn't like remote teams</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>I believe distributed teams...are suboptimal and less productive in the long run.</p></blockquote>
      <p><strong>The biggest anti-thesis to his opinion is <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>.</strong> Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson built <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> while David was in Denmark and Jason was in Chicago. The product is now almost 10 years old and has millions of (paying) customers.</p>
      <h3>Is 37signals an outlier?</h3>
      <p><strong>Mark might suggest that 37signals is an outlier.</strong> But the truth is, many of the products we use and love have been built with remote teams: Wordpress (<a href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/">Automattic</a>), <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/03/26/tales-from-the-trenches-github/">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://wildbit.com">Wildbit</a> (half the team is remote), <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/referral-badge/lorindaapps">Treehouse</a> (half the team is in Florida, the other half in Portland). <strong>Also, don't forget: most open-source projects are distributed.</strong></p>
      <p>Josh Cramer, of CramerDev, has an <a href="http://cramerdev.com/weblog/why-distributed-teams-are-making-your-traditional-office-obsolete">excellent post </a>on the advantages of remote teams. Here are a few of my observations:</p>
      <h3>It's the people, not the location, that matters</h3>
      <p>If you have excellent people committed to a common goal, it doesn't really matter where they're located: they're going to get it done. The big advantage that distributed teams have is <strong>they can attract the best people, no matter where they live.</strong> Bringing 10 people from different countries to San Francisco is a nightmare; why not save all that time and just let them telecommute?</p>
      <h3>Less distractions</h3>
      <p>When a remote worker is in her home office, she doesn't have to worry about the normal workday distractions. Interruptions from people tapping on the shoulder, office gossip and drama: these are all absent from her life. With a reasonable amount of discipline, the employee can focus primarily on the tasks at hand.</p>
      <h3>In-person meetings are richer, and more valuable</h3>
      <p>The nice thing about working virtually is that when the company <strong>does</strong> get-together (face to face) those meetings are taken seriously. The team uses every moment purposefully; there is no time to waste! Anecdotally, this seems to be the experience at <a href="http://wildbit.com/blog/2012/07/26/wildbit-retreat-summer-2012-in-palma-de-mallorca/">Wildbit</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1754-last-weeks-37signals-retreat-in-kohler-wisconsin">37signals</a>, and <a href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/">Automattic</a>.</p>
