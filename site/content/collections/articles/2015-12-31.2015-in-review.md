      <p>When I make stuff, I'm happy. When I don't make stuff, I'm not as happy. This theme keeps getting reinforced, year after year.</p>
      <p>I get energy from creating something and putting it out into the world. Having people connect with something you've made is a great reward.</p>
      <p>Here are some things I shipped in 2015:</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <ul>
      <li>29 episodes of the <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net">Build &amp; Launch</a> podcast</li>
      <li>28 <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/newsletter">email newsletters</a></li>
      <li>15 blog posts on my <a href="http://justinjackson.ca">personal site</a> (that's down from 26 in 2014)</li>
      <li>11 <a href="http://startupvernon.com">local meetups</a></li>
      <li>9 new products (the <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a> book and video <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz/video">course</a>, <a href="https://gum.co/marketingmakersbook">Marketing for Makers</a>, <a href="http://networkeffects.me/">Network Effects</a>, <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/book/the-product-hunt-handbook/">Product Hunt Handbook</a>, <a href="http://levelstheme.com/">Levels Theme</a>, <a href="http://productpress.me/">ProductPress</a>, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/buildandlaunch">Build &amp; Launch Book</a>, <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz/tinywins">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>)</li>
      <li>4 episodes of the <a href="http://productpeople.tv">Product People</a> podcast</li>
      <li>2 <a href="http://www.microconfeurope.com/speakers/justin-jackson/">conference talks</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>All of these were side-projects.</strong> I was consulting full-time and had to fit projects into evenings, weekends, and vacation days. The longest project to complete was Marketing for Developers. Projects like Tiny Marketing Wins took a day to complete.</p>
      <p><strong>2016 will be interesting </strong>because I've quit consulting full-time. So my focus will go from "side-projects" to "primary projects."</p>
      <h3>What were my biggest hits of 2015?</h3>
      <p>My friend Hiten Shah says: "Before you make plans, take a look at what's already working." Looking at what <em>worked</em> for you in 2015 is a great way to think about what you should do in the next 12 months.</p>
      <h4>Top blog posts</h4>
      <p>My blog was viewed about 130,000 times in 2015 (that's down from 300,000 in 2014). My top posts of the year were:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/heroes/">Don't follow your heroes</a> (January 2015) - 5,870 views</li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/product-people-persevere/">Keep making things</a> (June 2015) - 4,028 views</li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/help/">You need help</a> (March 2015) -3,418 views</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Why was there a reduction in traffic? I can think of a number of reasons: I was focused on writing <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">my book</a>, I was writing a lot for consulting clients, and I wasn't as focused on promoting on sites like Hacker News.</p>
      <p>Here's my posting patterns in 2015 vs 2014:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1253 size-large" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/posting-patterns-2015-1024x466.png" alt="Justin Jackson's blog stats for 2015" width="960" height="437" /></p>
      <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1122 size-large" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/posting-patterns-1024x466.png" alt="Justin Jackson's blog posting patterns" width="960" height="437" /></p>
      <p>My top traffic came from these countries:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>USA - 52,189 (40% of traffic)</li>
      <li>Canada - 13,813 (11% of traffic)</li>
      <li>UK - 9,386 (7% of traffic)</li>
      <li>Germany - 4,850 (4% of traffic)</li>
      <li>Australia - 3,329 (3% of traffic)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I published 4 pieces on Medium this year. These are usually things I've cross-posted (or re-written) from my regular blog. Here they are:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/product-people/how-to-get-more-customers-54f64220e430#.pnubmsvwj">How to get more customers</a> - 3,595 views</li>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/product-people/start-small-62d611ea2f8b#.i66skxa81">Start small</a> - 2,910 views</li>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/product-people/keep-making-stuff-c2f264ed4c08#.3icpsgn4e">Keep making stuff</a> - 1,891 views (in 2 days)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>#### Top side-projects</p>
      <p>Here are my top 3 products, ordered by revenue:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://gum.co/producthunt">Product Hunt Handbook</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>In 2014 I made $40k in side-project revenue. In 2013 I'd made $20k. In 2012 I'd made $10k.</p>
      <p>In 2015 I was hoping to double it once more and get to $80k. <strong>In total, I made around $66k</strong>. That's a 65% increase, but it's not quite where I wanted to be. If I'm going to replace consulting with product revenue in 2016, I need to be making over $10k / month.</p>
      <p>A few notes:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How did I increase revenue? Marketing for Developers. This book &amp; course is my "biggest" product to date. It accounted for about 55% of my product revenue.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping Marty and I would be able to get <a href="http://networkeffects.me">Network Effects</a> properly launched. We're close, and we're hoping to see some SaaS revenue in 2016.</li>
      <li>The exchange rate right now is awesome if you're earning US dollars and converting them to Canadian. Move to Canada!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's my revenue breakdown by country:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>USA - 39% (the majority coming from California)</li>
      <li>Canada - 8%</li>
      <li>UK - 9%</li>
      <li>Germany - 3%</li>
      <li>Australia - 3%</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Two observations:</strong> first, my site's traffic % correlate strongly with revenue %. Second, all my startup clients have a very similar geographic revenue breakdown. The USA is almost always 30-50% of revenue, followed by Canada, UK, Germany, and Australia.</p>
      <h4>Newsletter list</h4>
      <p>The number of people subscribed to <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/newsletter">my email list</a> grew 79% this year (from 5076 to 9085).</p>
      <p>A lot of that growth came from the <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz/tinywins/">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> email course. It was featured on Product Hunt, and ended up with over 2,000 subscribers in 48 hours. I've been procrastinating on doing an email course for years; I'm glad I finally did it.</p>
      <p>The rest of the growth came from blog posts, my podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/676485273740402688">the maker challenge</a>, and people signing up to receive sample chapters from my books.</p>
      <h3>Other significant events</h3>
      <h4>Consulting</h4>
      <p>I won't share exact numbers, but I had a very profitable year of doing consulting for startups (focused on marketing and product).</p>
      <p><strong>In November I made a big decision.</strong> I decided to quit consulting full-time. The idea? To focus exclusively on building my own stuff. This is the first time I've been able to do this since I was in college. It's very exciting (but also scary). I'm not opposed to doing some consulting in 2016, but I'd really like to give my own stuff a good go.</p>
      <p>The scary thing? Replacing all that revenue. I'm in a similar boat to <a href="http://casjam.com/making-progress-profitably/">Brian Casel here</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
        I’m in my thirties, married with a growing family (and currently the sole breadwinner), [and need to earn] close to $10,000/month.
      </p></blockquote>
      <h4>Travel</h4>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-m-thumb wp-image-1255" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/travel-960x195.jpg" alt="2015 travel photos" width="960" height="195" /></p>
      <p>Wowser. For a guy that doesn't like to travel, I travelled quite a bit this year.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>March:</strong> beauty snowboarding trip to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/z8oxf3DoZo/">Banff, Alberta</a>, and a trip to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/0dLLbFDoeK/">Edmonton, Alberta</a> for my friend Daryl's wedding.</li>
      <li><strong>April: </strong>went to my first <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/1wX7AxjoU9/">MicroConf in Las Vegas</a>. My wife got to come on this trip, which was really fun. I also gave a short <a href="https://vimeo.com/132139312">attendee talk</a> (my first talk in a long time).</li>
      <li><strong>May: </strong>a consulting trip to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/2pO8wEDoXx/">Portland</a>. Got to hang out with some great <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/2xE5wMjoYD/">PDX friends</a> while I was in town.</li>
      <li><strong>June: </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/3lu5Z-jobW/">family camping trip</a> to Haynes Point.</li>
      <li><strong>July: </strong>another big family trip! We had an awesome <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/4uG4IrDoTc/">road trip to the BC coast</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>August:</strong> holy dinah. I was invited to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7Icmjkjofi/">speak at MicroConf Europe</a>. My wife decided to surprise me, and booked 12 full days for me in Barcelona. An amazing trip. Got to meet many internet friends in-person for the first time, and had a blast exploring the city (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7SgX-BjoZc/">a few</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7VgsGTDody/">of my</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7B0xxKDoUP/">favorite photos</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>September: </strong>straight from Barcelona to Portland for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7ih7ZCDoaM/">XOXO Conference</a>. Too many <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7i6WaNDoe5/">great people</a> and experiences to count.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Planning for the new year</h3>
      <h4>Themes</h4>
      <p>I have a few themes I'm going to focus on this year:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Increase product revenue</strong>: I'd like to rely less on consulting, and more on products. To do that, I'd like to try to increase product revenue to $10k / month.</li>
      <li><strong>Make 100 things</strong>: for fun, I've created a <a href="http://megamaker.co/challenge/">2016 Maker Challenge</a>. The objective is to create little projects I can ship quickly. <a href="http://megamaker.co/challenge/">You can join here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Family flexibility</strong>: since I've quit consulting I have more opportunities to do stuff with my family. I've volunteered a handful of times at my kids' school, and this is the first time I've ever been home the entire Christmas break. I'd like to keep doing this.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on my strengths</strong>: see below.</li>
      <li><strong>Jeans vests</strong>: more jean vests.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>What I'd like to launch</h4>
      <p>Here are the projects I'd like to launch:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong><a href="http://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a></strong>: in January or February, I'll be launching the first season of my new podcast, <a href="http://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a>. This is where I'll be chronicling my story (of making 100 things) and stories from community members who join the challenge.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://networkeffects.me/">Network Effects</a></strong>: as mentioned above, Marty and I are aiming to get at least 10-20 paying customers in 2016.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/marketingformakers/">Marketing for Makers</a></strong>: there were a bunch of folks who asked for a non-technical version of Marketing for Devs. I did a small beta this year, but I'd like to do a proper launch in 2016.</li>
      <li><strong>Live event</strong>: I'd like to hold a product marketing event / workshop. Currently considering San Francisco, Edmonton and Portland.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Revenue plan for 2016</h4>
      <p>I'm aiming for a breakdown that looks like this:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>50% of revenue will come from books, courses, workshops (specifically <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>).</li>
      <li>25% of revenue will come software products (web apps, plugins, themes).</li>
      <li>25% of revenue will come from productized consulting (1 hour coaching calls for startups).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
      <p>Life is best when your actions reflect your temperament. This is why giving generic advice often fails: everyone has a different modus operandi. What works for me might not work for you.</p>
      <p>The most poignant advice given to me this year came from <a href="https://twitter.com/iwearyourshirt">Jason Zook</a>:</p>
      <p>[soundcloud url="https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/237561283" params="color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%" height="166" iframe="true" /]</p>
      <p><em>This was a driving force behind my new side-project: <a href="http://megamaker.co/challenge">MegaMaker</a> (you can <a href="http://live.megamaker.co/">follow my progress here</a>).</em></p>
      <p>I was reviewing an old personality test I'd done (<a href="http://kolbe.com">the Kolbe</a>) and found this description:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-m-thumb wp-image-1257" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/justin-job-960x176.png" alt="What's your ideal job?" width="960" height="176" /></p>
      <p>If you know me, you know this rings very true.</p>
      <p>This past year, I went for dinner with <a href="https://twitter.com/earthlingworks">Ruben Gamez</a>. One of the things he's done really well is focused on his "super power." He's really good at <span class="s1">eliminating distractions. He mentioned that <a href="https://twitter.com/peldi?lang=en">Peldi</a>'s strength is tenacious focus. <a href="https://twitter.com/noahkagan">Noah Kagen</a>'s </span><span class="s1">is thinking non-stop about value.</span></p>
      <p>The truth is, I'm different than many of my "product people" peers and <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/heroes/">heroes</a>. Ruben encouraged me to focus on my super powers. Leverage what I'm really good at. That's something I'd like to focus on in 2016.</p>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>Reading someone else's year in review <em>could</em> be helpful for you (<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/681941393984454656">as people have said here</a>). I have a love / hate relationship with them. Sometimes they have helpful lessons, and serve as other inspiration. But other times they can drive comparisons, jealousy, and melancholy.</p>
      <p>I hope there's something valuable for you in here. But don't take too much stock in my experience. My situation is unique. Yours is too!</p>
      <p>Let's agree on one thing:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Life is better when you make stuff.</p>
      <footer>- <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/theleviallen">Levi Allen</a></cite></footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p>All the best to you in 2016!</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
      Justin Jackson<br />
