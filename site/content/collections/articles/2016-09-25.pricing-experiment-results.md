      <p>Here are the revenue numbers from <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz/">Marketing for Developers</a>' book launch:</p>

      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rkjq1h7xYUtV0X26_mnlRy1N2Vx0OrOw_94jboRKhCc/edit?usp=sharing">Like many authors</a> of technical books, I priced it at $39. (This graph doesn't include sales from the video tiers)</p>
      <p>When it came time to write my most recent book, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt">Jolt</a>, I wanted to experiment with a <em data-redactor-tag="em">lower </em>price point: $9 pre-launch, $14.99 after that.</p>
      <p>I wondered: "If I price this lower, could I make up the revenue difference in volume?" (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/pricing/">you can read my whole rationale here</a>)</p>
      <p>Here are the results for Jolt so far:</p>

      <p>Now, these comparisons aren't perfect. I've included the first 72 days of sales for both but, as you can see, each had a different launch strategy. For Marketing for Developers, I did an early beta sale, stopped selling it for 45 days, and then did the official launch on Oct 15.</p>
      <p>To complete this picture, I'm going to show you launch numbers for Marketing for Developers, <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">including the video tiers</strong>:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1490 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/marketing-for-devs-launch-revenue-stats.png" alt="Graph: total revenue numbers from M4Devs launch" width="2128" height="994" /></p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Here's what I learned:</strong></p>
      <ol>
      <li>Both $14.99 and $39 price points had similar sales revenue at launch. <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">However</strong>, it often felt like I had to work twice as hard to get the same amount of revenue. (2.6 Jolts to get 1 Marketing for Devs).</li>
      <li>Product category matters a lot in terms of <em>perceived</em> value. An ebook on Amazon is $0.99 - $9.99, but the amount of effort required to produce that value is HUGE. Some product types produce better ROI than others.</li>
      <li>A lower price point is a <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">great</strong> way to get first-time customers. Many people who bought Jolt had never bought something from me before. Some have already gone on to buy other things I've made.</li>
      <li>Books are an enormous amount of work. ;) Jolt was the third one I've written, and I always forget how challenging they are to write, revise, and publish.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are probably other lessons in here I'm missing as well. <i>Let me know if you think of something!</i></p>

      <p>(I sent this to my newsletter folks first. <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter">Get on the list!</a>)</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">One more thing...</strong></p>
      <p>Many of my existing customers missed the comprehensive and tactical approach I took in the Marketing for Developers video tutorials.</p>
      <p>I'm happy to announce I'm doing a <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">major </strong>update to <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz/">Marketing for Developers</a> and turning it into a full-fledged course:</p>
      <p><a href="http://devmarketing.xyz"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1493" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dev-marketing-update.png" alt="The new Marketing for Developers Course" width="2672" height="1330" /></a></p>
      <p>There will be at least 5+ new instructional videos, 3+ new interviews, and interactive workbooks (that you can save to PDF).</p>
      <p>It will launch on October 15, 2016!</p>
