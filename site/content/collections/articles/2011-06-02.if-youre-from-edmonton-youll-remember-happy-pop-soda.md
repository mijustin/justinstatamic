      <p><strong>Happy Pop was a huge part of my childhood. </strong>Like many others in the Edmonton area, my family would go and pick up a crate of the brightly colored sodas every month or so.</p>
      <p>The odd thing about cultural artifacts from the 80's: you can't find them on the internet! <a title="Google happy pop search" href="http://www.google.ca/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1296&amp;bih=953&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=happy+pop&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=">Search "Happy Pop"</a> in Google Images and you'll get pictures of Lanvin purses; but no shots of a Happy Pop soda bottle.</p>
      <p>I'd searched everywhere; until one day I found <a href="http://ca-yd.com/">Chris Weides' website</a>.  Chris, who is from the USA, has a huge collection of pop bottles.  I saw that he had a Happy Pop bottle in his collection and asked him if he could send it to me.</p>
      <p>So here they are, the only photos I could find of Happy Pop on the internet!</p>
      <p><strong>Update: </strong>I just found a copy of the <a href="http://bit.ly/jmz4QO">Happy Pop logo on Canada's Trademark Database.</a></p>
