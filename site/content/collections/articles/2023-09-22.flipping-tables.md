      <p>To see your high score, you'll need to refresh the browser. I'll give a free copy of <a href="https://www.devmarketing.xyz/">​Marketing for Developers​</a> to the first person who gets a score over 150.</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h2>Hiring your kids</h2><p>This game is just a small piece of an experiment I ran this summer.</p><p>I hired my four kids (aged 13-20) to work on two types of projects with me in June-August:</p><ol><li><strong>Real work projects: </strong>they helped me edit my YouTube videos, update my blog, bookkeeping, edit my podcast show notes, create thumbnails, and more.</li><li><strong>Creative projects:</strong> we also worked on fun projects like this game. The idea was to help them experience the process of conceptualizing something, scoping it, building it, shipping it, and promoting it.</li></ol><p>They often came to the office with me (I rent a coworking space downtown).</p><p>I also paid them! They got to see (first-hand) what it was like to do the work I do and do projects that actually got shipped (website projects, YouTube videos, this game). </p><p>Having them participate in the "family business" has been immensely positive. The kids are all on payroll now and still work part-time for me on different projects.</p><p>It’s been a win-win situation where they gain real-world experience, and I get to pass on my knowledge, and skills, and share life with them.</p><p>The idea of hiring my kids came from my dad, who was great at hiring us when we were young. He was a principal at a private school and would hire us to do jobs like cleaning, data entry, and work in the cafeteria. Eventually, we graduated to more advanced jobs. For example, because I was interested in computers, he had me work with the IT admin and network the computer lab.</p><p>If you own your own business, I highly recommend working with your kids, once they're old enough.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson</p><p>Connect with me on:
