      <p>Before making my goals for 2015, I wanted to review 2014. Sometimes we lose sight of what we've accomplished the previous year. Here's the framework I'm using to review myself personally - <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/jfdi/2014yearinreview">you can get the worksheet here</a>.</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <h3>What did I make in 2014?</h3>
      <p>If you're like me, you get energy from creating something, and having people connect with what you've made.</p>
      <p>What counts as "making" something? Here are some things I shipped in 2014:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>68 <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/newsletter">email newsletters</a></li>
      <li>26 blog posts on my <a href="http://justinjackson.ca">personal site</a></li>
      <li>21 <a href="http://productpeople.tv">podcast episodes</a></li>
      <li>12 <a href="http://startupvernon.com">local meetups</a></li>
      <li>7 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPb8Pq410N5qvlyO1dHpa6A/videos">videos</a></li>
      <li>4 new products (<a href="http://productpeople.club/">The Club</a>, <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/audiencecourse/">Audience</a>, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/wordstheme">Words</a>, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/landingpage">Levels</a>)</li>
      <li>3 <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/audience/">webinars</a></li>
      <li>1 new <a href="http://coworkvernon.com">coworking office</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>A lot of those things seemed small when I was making them (like writing an individual blog post), but over a year those little things can add up to larger body of work.</p>
      <h3>What were my biggest hits of 2014?</h3>
      <p>My friend Hiten Shah says: "Before you make plans, take a look at what's already working." Looking at what <em>worked</em> for you in 2014 is a great way to think about what you should do in the next 12 months.</p>
      <h4>Top blog posts</h4>
      <p>This blog was viewed about 300,000 times in 2014. My top posts of the year were:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/we-are-not-normal-people/">We are not normal people</a> (January 2014) - 45,103 views</li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/where-do-you-find-the-time-for-side-projects/">Where do you find the time for side projects?</a> (January 2014) - 32,903 views</li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/validate-your-startup-idea/">A simple way to validate your startup idea</a> (February 2014) - 19,794 views</li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/2013-revenue-stats/">The 2013 revenue stats I didn't want to share</a> (January 2014) - 10,656 views</li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/serial/">Landing page teardown: Serial podcast</a> (November 2014) - 9,138 views</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can already see a pattern here: most of my "hits" came early on in the year, in January and February.</p>

      <p>A notable mention is the post I wrote for <a href="https://sprint.ly">Sprintly</a> in November called <a href="https://sprint.ly/blog/your-developers-arent-slow/">Your Developers Aren't Slow</a>, which was viewed 126,850 times.</p>
      <p><a href="http://glui.me/?i=n17dglt29590ub8/2014-12-30_at_11.15_AM_2x.png/">Here are the most shared posts from my website from 2014</a>.</p>
      <h4>Top products</h4>
      <p>Here are my top products, ordered by revenue:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><a href="http://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/audiencecourse/">Build Your Audience</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://gum.co/amplification/2014review">Amplification + Hacker News Handbook</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/landingpage">Levels Landing Page</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/wordstheme">Words Theme</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>In total, I made around $40k in side-projects this year. A few notes on this:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/audiencecourse/">The Build Your Audience</a> course had a great launch (5 figures), but I stopped promoting it once I realized how expensive the course platform fees were (almost 15% of sales!). One of my goals for 2015 is to get it switched to a different platform.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to 4x my revenue from side-projects this year. Instead, I did 2x <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/2013-revenue-stats/">what I did last year</a>. I talk about this more on <a href="https://jackedup.simplecast.fm/2">this episode of Jacked Up</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/">Brennan Dunn</a> recommended I test my product ideas by <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/audience">doing a workshop first</a>. That's what I did for Build Your Audience, and it really worked. It helps validate that people will pay for your idea.</li>
      <li>Move to Canada! At the end of the year the Canadian dollar slipped to $0.86 USD. This should boost my revenues quite a bit going into 2015, as most of my sales come from the US.</li>
      <li>Yup, I'm still consultingÂ full-time. Why? I'm planning on writing a post on this soon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My goal for 2015? Double side-income again to $80k.</p>
      <h4>Newsletter list</h4>
      <p>The number of people subscribed to <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/newsletter">my newsletter</a> grew 184% this year (from 1786 to 5076).</p>
      <p>I also switched to Nathan Barry's <a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/75552">Convert Kit</a> for email.</p>
      <h3>Other significant events</h3>
      <h4>Work</h4>
      <p>After 6 years, I left my Product Manager job at <a href="http://industrymailout.com">Industry Mailout</a>, and became a full-time contractor at <a href="http://quickleft.com">Quick Left</a>. I've been working with them on product marketing for <a href="http://sprint.ly">Sprintly</a> since August, and it's been a blast.</p>
      <h4>Travel</h4>
      <p>I love meeting new people, and exploring new places, but travel itself (planes, trains and automobiles) always feels like a huge drain. I'm generally happy to stay home around <a href="http://vernonliving.tumblr.com/">Vernon, BC</a>.</p>
      <p>That being said, I had some great trips this year:<br />
      - <strong>January</strong>: My buddy <a href="http://icetothebrim.com/about/">Chase Reeves</a> pulled me into <a href="http://fizzle.co/sparkline/host-awesome-conference-panel">doing a panel</a> with him at NMX this year. I also got to hang out with other great folks: <a href="http://www.calebwojcik.com/">Caleb Wojcik</a>, <a href="http://productivityist.com/">Mike Vardy</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mschechter">Michael Schecter</a>, <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/">Nathan Barry</a>, <a href="http://100mba.net/">Omar &amp; Nichole</a>, and so many more. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chasereeves/sets/72157639538742044/">Here's some photos</a>.<br />
      - <strong>April</strong>: Visited Edmonton, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/m795aYDofG/">and it snowed</a>!<br />
      - <strong>May</strong>: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/n1o4njjoal/">Visited Portland</a> with my wife. This is when I first talked with Joe Stump about working with Sprintly.<br />
      - <strong>August</strong>: Had my first trip to <a href="http://instagram.com/p/rN4CrmDoer/">San Francisco</a> with my Sprintly co-conspirator, Justin Abrahms. Met up with many internet friends: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/rM9YzHjoV4/">Hiten Shah</a>, Brennan Dunn, Corbett Barr, Andrew Culver, Ryan Delk, Jessica Jalsevac, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/495616971250364416">Chikodi and Austin Gunter</a>.<br />
      - <strong>September</strong>: Went to <a href="http://instagram.com/p/s-5FDzjoQH/">XOXO Festival</a> in Portland. Amazing.<br />
      - <strong>October</strong>: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/uM9uD-joQR/">Back to Portland</a> for the <a href="https://sprint.ly/blog/video-office/">Quick Left office grand opening</a>.</p>
      <h3>Planning for the new year</h3>
      <h4>Themes</h4>
      <p>I have a few themes I'm going to focus on this year:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Increase quality</strong>: This means better audio production on my <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net">new podcast</a>, nicer video for my courses, and working with an editor when I write.</li>
      <li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: I've been pushing myself to collaborate with others more often, and I'm finding that when I do, we create better stuff, more quickly than I would on my own.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>What I'd like to launch</h4>
      <p>Here are the projects I'd like to launch:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>A new podcast</strong>: in January 2015, I'll be launching the first season of my new podcast, <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/">Build &amp; Launch</a>, where I'll launch a <em>small</em> product every week.</li>
      <li><strong>New members for Product People Club</strong>: we haven't invited any new members to <a href="http://productpeople.club/">Product People Club</a> in ages (despite there being nearly 1,000 people on the waiting list). I'm hoping to onboard at least 10-20 new members in 2015.</li>
      <li><strong>Re-launch Build Your Audience course</strong>: as mentioned, I'd like to get <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/audiencecourse/">this course</a> off it's current platform, and onto something I can control. I also have lots of new material I'd like to add.</li>
      <li><strong>New version of Amplification</strong>: I'd like to re-write my ebook, <a href="https://gum.co/amplification/2014review">Amplification</a>, and focus on how product companies can use content marketing to drive more sales.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing email course</strong>: I'm working on a new email course called <em><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/12-months-of-marketing/">12 months of marketing</a></em>, where I'll outline a new tactic each month.</li>
      <li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: I'm working with a few partners right now on launching a new SaaS tool, a new Gumroad plugin, and a few other projects. Stay tuned!</li>
      </ol>
