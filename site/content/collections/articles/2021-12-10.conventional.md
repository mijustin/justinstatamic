      <p>All bits of wisdom have limits, boundaries, thresholds. </p><p>Usually, it's your individual context that will determine whether advice is wise (or unwise).</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1431645749977231365">James Clear</a>, we should consider the limits of the wisdom you receive:</p><blockquote><p>Everything is an oversimplification. Reality is messy and complex.

However, it has a missing half:</p><p>"Too much comfort dulls the mind, <strong>and</strong>... <em>sometimes our minds really need comfort in order to thrive</em>."</p><p>I believe that good wisdom invites tension; it''s comfortable with duality, context, and nuance.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">twitter.com/mijustin</a></p>'
