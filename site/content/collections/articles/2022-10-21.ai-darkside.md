A tool like Lex could help me write content for <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor.fm</a> more efficiently. An article that would normally take me 2 hours to write (including procrastination) took 20-40 minutes with Lex.</p><p>I didn''t really consider the deeper implications of this technology until I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/Altimor/status/1583341896666996738">this tweet</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"GPT3 has already replaced much of my Google usage, and almost all my Wikipedia usage."</p></blockquote>'
