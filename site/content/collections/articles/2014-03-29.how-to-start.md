      <p>What's one thing you could do to help people right now?</p>
      <p>The people I've been interviewed on <a href="http://productpeople.tv">Product People</a> keep telling me the same thing:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"I wish I'd started with something smaller."</p></blockquote>
      <p>We all have big ideas for big things we'd like to make. Maybe it's a full blown SaaS application, or a 500 page book, or the next viral mobile game.</p>
      <p>You have big dreams (I have big dreams too). But I'm going to recommend you put them on hold, and do something different:</p>
      <p>Build something small, and sell it for $1.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"If you can get anyone to show up and pay you $1, you’ve made it on the internet." - Dan Martell</p></blockquote>
      <p>I don't mean "one literal dollar". I'm talking about building something that has value, that's not too complicated, and that you could build and sell in a week, a month, or 3 months.</p>
      <p>Maybe it's a <a href="http://zfer.us/hy0d4">Wordpress theme</a>, a <a href="http://sachagreif.com/ebook/">little book</a>, an <a href="http://smallicons.net/">icon set</a>, or a <a href="https://twitter.com/earthlingworks/status/444593157833912320">video course</a>. Jason Fried's first product was a little database program he made in FileMaker Pro. <a title="Twenty dollars in an envelope" href="http://justinjackson.ca/jason-fried-high-school/">He sold it for $20</a>.</p>
      <p>Start with something small.</p>
      <p>The advantage is that you'll no longer be a person with ideas - you'll be a person with customers. You can't talk to ideas, but you can talk to people. And once you have customers, you're officially in business.</p>
      <p>It's like dating: you don't ask someone to marry you 5 minutes after meeting them. You start small: you invite them out for coffee, take them to a show, or go for a walk. These are small acts, but they're meaningful. Gradually, your relationship develops into something bigger (maybe even a life-long partnership).</p>
      <p>Building products is about helping human beings. People have BIG COMPLICATED NEEDS, but they also have small simple needs. It's ok to identify the "little" needs first.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Starting small puts 100% of your energy into solving real problems for real people." Derek Sivers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KLnXjqKL5g">Start Now: No Funding Needed</a></p></blockquote>
      <p>Making and selling things is actually quite hard. You can't just show up and win; you need to ramp up slowly. My buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewcrist/status/449720456552402944">Matthew Crist</a> says it's like people who decide to run a marathon. Marathoners don't just show up on race day and run 26 miles. They start small, probably with 5 miles. Even 5 mile runs require a <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/50933/5K-Novice-Training-Program">training schedule</a>; a gradual ramping up. Running a marathon means lots of practice before the big race.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Making money takes practice, just like playing the piano takes practice." - Jason Fried, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1985-making-money-takes-practice-like-playing-the-piano-takes-practice">Signal vs Noise</a></p></blockquote>
      <p>Part of your training program, as a product person, is to figure out how to build things that people want and need. You can learn techniques from books, but nothing beats first-hand experience. You have to be like the marathon runner: you have to put in the miles. Build something, and try to sell it. No one showed up? Figure out why. It's a lot better to make your mistakes on the 5 mile race, rather than the marathon.</p>

      <p>One of my favourite stories, is of a man named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingvar_Kamprad ">Ingvar Kamprad</a>. He started practicing sales young: he would go door to door on his bicycle, and sell matches to his neighbours. After a while he moved up to Christmas decorations, fish and ball point pens. Then at age 17 he started his first company. He called it IKEA. A company that had <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/about_ikea/newsitem/101413_FY2013_IKEA_Group_sales">$37 billion dollars in sales</a> last year, literally started with a boy selling matches. IKEA is huge, but matches are small.</p>
      <p>Start small.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
