      <p>But "The Gambler" never answers that question: how <b>do </b>you know when to fold, and when to walk away?</p><h2>Look for that big response</h2><p>When Taylor Otwell (the creator of <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>) launched his first paid product, nobody showed up.</p><blockquote><p>"My original idea was to create an invoice manager for lawn companies. In 2011, I built it with another guy. We called it Coin Fly. We launched it, and we used it, but no one else really signed up."</p></blockquote><p>Taylor kept building things. Three years later he launched Forge, and got a very different reaction:</p><blockquote><p>Within a month it had about 1,000 customers.</p></blockquote><p>Same creator, and two very different results.</p><p>This is the advantage of launching sequential projects: if one takes off, you can feel the difference.</p><p>Taylor's experience isn't unique. Lots of other founders I know experienced something similar.</p><p>Derek Sivers was trying to make it as a professional musician for years. <a href="https://sivers.org/hitswitch">In this post</a>, he describes the grind:</p><blockquote><p>I had spent twelve years trying to promote my various projects. It always felt like an uphill battle, trying to open locked or slamming doors.</p></blockquote><p>Then, in 1997, he created a company called CD Baby. And it became a crazy success. He later said:</p><blockquote><p>For the first time in my life, I had made something that people really wanted. Don’t waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response.</p></blockquote><p>Good businesses have a momentum that's hard to describe. <b>It doesn't always show up right away.</b> For Disney, it took 10 years. When Nathan Barry launched&nbsp;<a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/75552">ConvertKit</a>, he spent 3 years before he got the response he wanted. MailChimp was a side-project for 6 years.</p><p>But, eventually, you should see good traction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>What does traction look like?</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlk/status/1081363657328492545">Jason Lemkin</a> says that for SaaS companies it's "$8k MRR / $100k ARR, maybe less." Early on, you can evaluate your idea's potential by looking at:</p><ul><li>How many people respond</li><li>How enthusiastically they respond</li></ul><p>An enthusiastic response to your idea is a good start, but it's not enough.
      
      Eventually, you should see lots of strangers lining up to buy your product.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Most important:&nbsp;</b>if you have something people <b>really </b>want, you shouldn't have to put a massive amount of effort into convincing them. Yes, it will take some effort to position your product properly. But once that's done, people should be coming to you on their own. It shouldn't feel like a grind. Like Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/hitswitch">says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of trying to create demand, you’re managing the huge demand.</p></blockquote><p><b>How long should you wait for that to happen?</b>&nbsp;That's up to you. It usually depends on how much time, money, and energy you have left. The internet has definitely given us the ability to test ideas faster.&nbsp;</p>
