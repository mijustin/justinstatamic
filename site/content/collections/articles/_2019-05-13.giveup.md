    text: '<p>But "The Gambler" never answers that question: how <b>do </b>you know when to fold, and when to walk away?</p><h2>Look for that huge response</h2><p>When Taylor Otwell (the creator of <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>) launched his first paid product, nobody showed up.</p><blockquote><p>"My original idea was to create an invoice manager for lawn companies. In 2011, I built it with another guy. We called it Coin Fly. We launched it, and we used it, but no one else really signed up."</p></blockquote><p>Taylor kept building things. Three years later he launched Forge, and got a very different reaction:</p><blockquote><p>Within a month it had about 1,000 customers.</p></blockquote><p>Same creator, and two very different results.</p><p>This is the advantage of launching sequential projects: if one takes off, you can feel the difference.</p><p>Taylor''s experience isn''t unique. Lots of other founders I know experienced something similar.</p><p>Derek Sivers was trying to make it as a professional musician for years. <a href="https://sivers.org/hitswitch">In this post</a>, he describes the grind:</p><blockquote><p>I had spent twelve years trying to promote my various projects. It always felt like an uphill battle, trying to open locked or slamming doors.</p></blockquote><p>Then, in 1997, he created a company called CD Baby. And it became a crazy success. He later said:</p><blockquote><p>For the first time in my life, I had made something that people really wanted. Donâ€™t waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response.</p></blockquote><p><br></p>'
