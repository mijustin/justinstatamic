In nearly 14 years on the platform, Twitter''s had a net-positive effect on my life.

    text: '<p>It seems likely that under his leadership, Twitter will get worse.</p><p><b>Where can the bootstrappers, founders, devs, indie makers, and others who found a community on Twitter, go?</b></p><p>When I asked this question on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1587198024174153729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, Jack''s response was pretty indicative:</p><p><i>"[Nothing really comes close to replicating the watering hole of Twitter].
