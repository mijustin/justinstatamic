      <p>Someone on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">my email list</a> just asked me:</p>
      <blockquote><p>How do you get over perfectionist tendencies, and put stuff out there?</p></blockquote>
      <p>Reading his email, the first thing out of my head was:</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/749659411652550656?lang=en">"You don't learn until you ship."</a></p>
      <p>I can tinker with something, try to get it perfect, but until I get feedback, the idea has no value. The longer I sit on a project, the more it festers. The drive to learn and improve is what moves me forward.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I want to figure out: "what does my audience truly need?" The only way to figure that out, is to show them something I've made.</p>
      <p><strong>The other thing I've learned:</strong> the more frequently you ship, the easier it gets. Shipping is a muscle like anything else. Actually, for me it's more like oxygen. I need to put something out every day, or I'm just not breathing.</p>
      <p>Give yourself a goal: "I'm going to make <em>this thing </em>by <em>this date</em>." Go do it. And then do it again, and again, and again. That's what's worked for me.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
