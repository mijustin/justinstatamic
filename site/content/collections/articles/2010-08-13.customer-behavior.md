    text: '<p>We sold skateboard decks, snowboards, clothing, and accessories.</p><p>And our shop was awesome. We really cared about our customers. We had a well designed store interior. We stocked the best brands. We were principled, we had a point of view: "You don''t need to go to the city to shop, you can shop local!"<br></p><p>But we soon discovered a problem. Our customer didn''t really care about shopping local.</p><p>They already had a solution that was working for them: they drove to the big city (about 35 minutes away). They would go on a Saturday and visit multiple shops, with a bigger selection than we could ever have. Additionally, in the early 2000s, internet shopping was becoming a thing. Kids were discovering they could get the same product, for less, online.</p><p><strong>Once we discovered this, we tried to change their behavior.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>We launched "shop local" campaigns, and tried to offer competitive pricing. We also sponsored local athletes, put on shows, and even launched our own magazine.</p><p>But ultimately, none of that mattered. Customers were already in motion. Changing their behavior would have been like trying to reverse the flow of a river.</p><h2>Humans do what''s easiest</h2><p>There''s a popular design meme that shows a paved pathway (what the designer envisioned), and the reality (a shortcut path next to it, worn into the grass).</p>'

    text: '<p>Don''t ever lose track of the idea that a <strong>business needs to make money</strong>. In retail, that means lots and lots of traffic. If there''s no traffic at your proposed location, in doesn''t matter <strong>how awesome</strong> your shop is or <strong>how good your idea is</strong>, it''s not going to fly. This applies to other businesses as well: you can''t change the way an entire market operates.</p><p>Don''t go into business because of a particular ideal (ie. "shopping local is better").&nbsp; Instead, identify a group of people who need a particular product or service... and <strong>then go where they are</strong>.&nbsp; Once you''re there, you need to test out your business.&nbsp; I will discuss that in my next post.</p>'
