    text: '<p>Right now, Black people in America are hurting.</p><blockquote><p>"We’ve seen brown and black people killed by the very people who were supposed to protect and serve. For having a car that broke down, for walking, for running, for playing loud music, going to church, driving or reading a book in their own car." – Chris Lema</p></blockquote><p>Chris wrote a powerful post about how "we’ve spent the last 35 years witnessing exactly how little the lives of people are valued if they’re not part of the dominant culture." I encourage you to <a href="https://chrislema.com/living-in-the-dominant-culture">read it</a>.</p><p>I''m Canadian, and in the past, I naively thought that racial issues were "not my problem." This was incredibly ignorant of me; I''m embarrassed that I thought that way.</p><p><b>Racism is real. It affects people in the bootstrapping community. It affects our peers, customers, and partners. It affects my friends.</b></p><blockquote><p>"Nobody''s free until everybody''s free." – Fannie Lou Hamer</p></blockquote><p>Here are things I''m doing right now:</p><ol><li><b>Listening and supporting.</b>&nbsp;My Black friends, peers, customers, and community members are hurting. This isn''t the time for me to tell them what I think.</li><li><b>Educating myself.&nbsp;</b>I''ve just started reading "So You Want to Talk About Race" by&nbsp;Ijeoma Oluo. "Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions listeners don''t dare ask."</li><li><b>Acting</b>. I''ve donated to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thelovelandfoundation.org/ways-to-give/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Loveland Foundation</a>, and I''m amplifying Black voices on Twitter, but I know that''s not enough. Those are still pretty convenient and comfortable things for me to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RachRodgersEsq" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Rodgers</a>&nbsp;reminded me of this: "Being an ally means getting uncomfortable. It means risking your status and your reputation." I''m still wrestling with that: what am I willing to do, to put my life on the line for people suffering from injustice?</li></ol><p>One thing people like me, who have a platform, is to create space for Black people. I run an online community, and I recently posted this message:</p><blockquote><p>I want to be clear. Here in this space, we stand against racism and injustice.</p></blockquote><p><i>Our&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MegaMakers/code-of-conduct" rel="noopener noreferrer">code of conduct</a>&nbsp;states that we don''t "tolerate harassment of participants in any form." Right now, we need to go a step further. In this group, there are folks who have experienced racism their whole lives. They''re hurting. Here, they are free to express their anger, hurt, and frustration. This is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the time for the rest of us to tell them what we think.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>We''re here to listen, support, and respond by being their advocates.</i></p>'
