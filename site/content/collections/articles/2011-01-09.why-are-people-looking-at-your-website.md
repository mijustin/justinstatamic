      <p>It's easy to forget about our <em>visitors</em> and focus on what <em>we want</em> in our website: perhaps a pretty design, a robust online catalog, or a flashy animation. Let's look at your site from your <em>audience's perspective.</em><br>
      </p><h2>The 3 most important things your visitors are looking for:</h2><p>Generally, a website visitor wants to <strong>do</strong> the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Find your contact information:</strong> This is often overlooked. The web is the new phone book. When people seek a company's contact information, they visit your website. For most businesses, you should have your phone number, email, or address on your homepage. <strong>This has an added benefit for mobile users:</strong> they can click on your address, get directions or your phone number, and call you immediately. Your "contact page" should be easy to find and prominently featured on your main menu.</li><li><strong>Find out who you are and what you stand for: </strong>what's your story? Who are your staff people? Why are you in business? <strong>Cut the corporate speech and use your relational voice </strong>to describe your business. Use 1-3 paragraphs to describe your business and your history. After that, introduce yourself and your staff with a short bio.</li><li><strong>Hear your expertise in your industry: </strong>this is where blogging comes in. One of the greatest gifts you can give your visitors is <strong>good information.</strong> Share your expertise in your field. Answer questions like: "What are common mistakes consumers make?" or "What to look for in a service provider." The owners of <a href="http://37signals.com/svn">37signals</a> have this axiom: <strong><em>people trust those that teach them</em></strong>. The best way to do this is to start a blog and post between 1-4 times a month.</li></ol><h3>Other resources:</h3><ul><li><a href="http://firstsiteguide.com/make-website/">How to make a website</a>: the beginner's guide to getting a small business online</li></ul>
