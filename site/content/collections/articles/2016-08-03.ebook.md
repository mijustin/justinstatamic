      <p>The trickiest part about publishing an e-book is getting it into all the right file formats for Kindle, Apple iBooks, Kobi, and other readers. This is a tutorial on how I did it for my newest book, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt">Jolt</a>.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:40px;">Here are the steps:</h3>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Write, edit and format on Reedsy. </strong>I wrote <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt">Jolt</a> on <a href="https://reedsy.com/r/justin-jackson">Reedsy</a>. For my last book, <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>, I used <a href="https://pressbooks.com">Pressbooks</a> which is also good.</li>
      <li><strong>Export PDF version from Reedsy. </strong>Reedsy is similar to Medium in that the writing UI looks very similar to the PDF output.</li>
      <li><strong>Export ePub version from Reedsy.</strong> I've tried all sorts of ePub formatting tools, and this has been my favorite output so far.</li>
      <li><strong>Use ePub version to create MOBI in Calibre.</strong> Here's the tricky part. For people to read your book on their Kindle, the file needs to be small (less than 10 MB). Initially I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211">Amazon's KindleGen</a>, but the outputted file was way too big (50 MB). After that I tried <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>, which is way better. When converting ePub to MOBI, it produced a well-formatted file that was 6 MB.</li>
      <li><strong>Upload the files to Gumroad for sale.</strong> Currently, I'm only <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/joltbook/">selling Jolt on Gumroad</a>. In the future I may decide to expand to Amazon's Kindle store.</li>
      </ol>
