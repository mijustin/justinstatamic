    text: '<h3>Self-publishing steps:</h3><ol><li><strong>Write, edit and format on Reedsy.&nbsp;</strong>I wrote <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt">Jolt</a>&nbsp;on <a href="https://reedsy.com/r/justin-jackson">Reedsy</a>. For my&nbsp;last book, <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>, I used <a href="https://pressbooks.com">Pressbooks</a> which is also good.</li><li><strong>Export PDF version from Reedsy.&nbsp;</strong>Reedsy is similar to Medium in that the writing UI looks very similar to the PDF output.</li><li><strong>Export ePub version from Reedsy.</strong>&nbsp;I''ve tried all sorts of ePub formatting tools, and this has been my favorite output so far.</li><li><strong>Use ePub version to create MOBI in Calibre.</strong>&nbsp;Here''s the tricky part. For people to read your book on their Kindle, the file needs to be small (less than 10 MB). Initially, I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211">Amazon''s KindleGen</a>, but the outputted file was way too big (50 MB). After that, I tried <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>, which is way better. When converting ePub to MOBI, it produced a well-formatted file that was 6 MB.</li><li><strong>Upload the files to Podia for sale.</strong>&nbsp;Currently, I''m <a href="https://join.megamaker.co/jolt">selling Jolt on my Podia store</a>&nbsp;and on Amazon. I earn way more on Podia and highly recommend them (<a href="https://www.podia.com/?via=justin">sign up here</a>).</li></ol>'
