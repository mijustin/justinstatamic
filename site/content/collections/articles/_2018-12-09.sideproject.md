    text: '<p>That tweet exploded. It struck a nerve. People began to reply with their personal startup stories.</p><p>Jeff Bargmann shared his experience:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"It took six years to move Fences from pet project to general availability. And then six years of hacking on back-burner to find profitability. Twelve years in all, 2/3 of which was patience."</p></blockquote><p>Jonnie Hallman said his app for freelancers is just now at a point where theyâ€™re finding their footing:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Approaching year 5 with Cushion and I have a feeling this is our year."</p></blockquote><p>Rob Belcher mentioned that his finance firm had done a study on the topic:</p><blockquote><p>Our data from a survey of ~950 B2B SaaS companies showed that the median time to $1M ARR is six years.</p></blockquote><p>These responses got me thinking about <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, the podcasting platform I co-founded with Jon Buda.

    text: '**Sidebar:** the online course business is very launch-driven. <em>Producing new material is what drives sales.</em> But creating that material requires a ton of energy and focus (6-12 months). The folks doing well in that space (like my friends Adam Wathan and Wes Bos) dedicate a significant portion of their time to producing new content. It''s hard to do grow a SaaS **and** launch a new course every year.'
