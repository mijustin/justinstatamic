In the meantime, they were consulting, allowing app revenue to grow on the side.&nbsp;</p><p>I realized this was true for other bootstrappers I admired too: Todoist, Wildbit, Basecamp.&nbsp;</p><p>I wondered:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of heaping expectations on our new startups, what if we just give them time to grow? Instead of hustling for immediate growth, should we focus on slow, steady gains?</p></blockquote><p>When I got back to our hotel for lunch, I tweeted:</p>'

    text: '<p>That tweet exploded. It struck a nerve. People began to reply with their personal startup stories.</p><p>Jeff Bargmann shared his experience:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"It took six years to move Fences from pet project to general availability. And then six years of hacking on back-burner to find profitability. Twelve years in all, 2/3 of which was patience."</p></blockquote><p>Jonnie Hallman said his app for freelancers is just now at a point where theyâ€™re finding their footing:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Approaching year 5 with Cushion and I have a feeling this is our year."</p></blockquote><p>Rob Belcher mentioned that his finance firm had done a study on the topic:</p><blockquote><p>Our data from a survey of ~950 B2B SaaS companies showed that the median time to $1M ARR is six years.</p></blockquote><p>These responses got me thinking about <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, the podcasting platform I co-founded with Jon Buda. We launched four months ago, and just passed $4,000 in MRR:</p>'

    text: '<p>It''s been exciting to build and grow our app on the side. But it''s also been hard. With hundreds of paying customers, we''re dedicating more of our time to serving them. But, the business isn''t earning enough to pay us for our time.</p><p>It''s been particularly challenging for me. Since 2016, I''ve supported myself with <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">M4Devs</a> and <a href="https://join.megamaker.co">other courses</a>. But my revenue''s fallen this year as I''ve dedicated more time to Transistor.</p>'

    text: '**Sidebar:** the online course business is very launch-driven. <em>Producing new material is what drives sales.</em> But creating that material requires a ton of energy and focus (6-12 months). The folks doing well in that space (like my friends Adam Wathan and Wes Bos) dedicate a significant portion of their time to producing new content. It''s hard to do grow a SaaS **and** launch a new course every year.'

    text: '<p>So, as 2018 is winding down, I''ve been exploring my options:</p><h3>1. Work on Transistor on the side, but get a job/consulting so I can pay my bills consistently.</h3><p>In the past, I''ve done product marketing for other tech companies, and made a good living at it. Maybe, having a few consulting clients is the best fit for me right now. Jon could keep his day-job, and I''d have a more reliable income stream.</p><p>This "slow and steady gains over time" approach also feels calming. It removes a lot of pressure for us to "grow fast so we can pay ourselves right away."</p><h3>2. Take investment so we can go full-time sooner.</h3><p>There are some new funding options in the bootstrapped space. <a href="https://earnestcapital.com/">Earnest Capital</a> and <a href="https://tinyseed.com/">TinySeed</a>&nbsp;seem tailor-fit for founders like Jon and me.<br></p><p>A $200,000 investment would give us about a year''s worth of runway, which could be enough time for us to reach $20,000 per month in revenue.</p><h3>3. Keep things the way they are.</h3><p>Or, we could keep our current path. There''s a lot of tension, but maybe we can sprint hard, and acquire enough customers to go full-time sooner?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>'
