      <p>Loved this interchange between Joe Stump and Ryan King on the <a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/business-of-coding-business-of-coding-with-ryan-king">Business of Coding podcast</a>. Joe starts it off with a question:</p>
      <blockquote><p><em>"A lot of engineers fall into the 'build it and they will come' trap. Have you found that?"</em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/joestump">Joe Stump</a></p></blockquote>
      <p>Ryan King said he agreed, and went on to address a problem I've observed as well:</p>
      <blockquote><p><em>"People sometimes mistake hard problems (in the computer science sense) for valuable problems (in the business sense). Sometimes that venn diagram overlaps (like Google's search algorithms). But there's a number of cases where there's a really valuable problem, but it's not particularly hard on the technology side (AirBnB is an example of this)."</em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/rk">Ryan King</a></p></blockquote>
      <p>The whole episode is excellent, with lots of practical tips for engineers and business folks alike:Â <a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/business-of-coding-business-of-coding-with-ryan-king">you can listen to the whole episode here</a>.</p>
