      <p>Here are the tools I use, ordered for importance. To me, "important" means: "how I make my living."</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="http://wpengine.com/?SSAID=760553">WPengine</a> and WordPress</strong> - at the end of the day, I make money from my words. It's where I've built my reputation.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://m.do.co/c/d12c8c2c375a">Digital Ocean</a></strong> - all my apps and coding projects are deployed here. I like it way better than Heroku.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/75552">ConvertKit</a></strong> - my newsletter is where I build relationships, and earn trust. This is where I'll share what I'm learning, and ultimately ask people to buy.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a></strong> - Podia is an all-in-one selling platform for solopreneurs. It's where I sell <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/#courses">my digital products</a>: downloads, courses, and books.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://store.telestream.net/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=TELESTRE&amp;AFFILIATE=89620&amp;PATH=http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">ScreenFlow</a></strong> - I believe the future of my business is in video + video courses. I'm in ScreenFlow almost every day. Sometimes I use it to "hijack audio" during interviews. Sometimes I use it to edit video. It's getting a lot of use.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://reedsy.com/">Reedsy</a></strong> - after trying iBooks Author and Pressbooks to write my books, I've finally settled on Reedsy for writing, layout, and publishing of ebooks.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://transistor.fm/?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=jjlinks">Transistor</a></strong> - my podcasts have been one of the biggest ways I've built authority and reputation. Transistor is dead simple, and has great analytics. Plus, it's cheaper than what I was paying Amazon S3 to host them!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Those are the big ones. I'll continue to add / modify this list as I think of other things. <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" src="https://club.megamaker.co/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" alt=":wink:" /></p>
