    text: '<p>Jon and I didn''t start working on our startup, <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, together until we were both in our late 30s.</p><p>When we launched, in <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/transistor#transistor-fm">August 2018</a>, I had just turned 38, and Jon had just turned 37.</p><p>Today, Transistor has made millions of dollars in revenue, and we’re both in our 40s.</p><p>There''s a popular narrative in Silicon Valley that you have to be in your 20s to build a successful startup. (At a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2007/03/26/start-up-advice-for-entrepreneurs-from-y-combinator-startup-school/">2007 Stanford event</a>, Mark Zuckerberg told the audience: "I want to stress the importance of being young and technical. Young people are just smarter.")</p><p><strong>But the idea that "young people make better startup founders" is not always true!</strong></p><p>According to research collected by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz for <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/dont-trust-your-gut-seth-stephens-davidowitz?variant=39416225038370">his book</a>, “a sixty-year-old startup founder has a roughly three times higher chance of creating a valuable business than a thirty-year-old start-up founder.”</p><p>He continues:</p><p>Researchers found that the average age of a business founder in the United States is 41.9 years old. They discovered that older founders consistently had higher probabilities of success, at least until the age of sixty.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/jones-ben/htm/Age%20and%20High%20Growth%20Entrepreneurship.pdf">the paper</a> that he cites, there''s a fair amount of data that shows that older founders achieve better outcomes:</p>'

    text: '<p>What''s the secret? Why do older founders often fare better?</p><p>Experience!</p><p><strong>Folks in their 40s, 50s, and 60s have accumulated skills, work experience, intuition, connections, and financial resources.</strong> Older founders can "stack" these advantages when they launch their company. </p><p>In many cases, it''s someone''s personal network that makes the difference.  </p><p>When we launched Transistor, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1000167960474861568">"who we knew, and who knew us"</a> was crucial. It helped us get a meeting at Spotify HQ (and early access to their podcasting directory), solve our CDN and database challenges, hire amazing people, and get our first 100 customers.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/dont-trust-your-gut-seth-stephens-davidowitz?variant=39416225038370">his book</a>, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz also found that employment experience gives older founders a huge boost:</p><p>"Entrepreneurs are roughly twice as likely to build an extremely successful company if they previously worked in the field in which they started the company."</p><p>As I''ve <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/misconceptions">mentioned before</a>: <strong>it''s unlikely that you''ll spot an opportunity in a space you''re not familiar with</strong>. It''s much more likely that you''ll find an unmet demand in a category that you understand. </p><p>Jon, my co-founder, had previously built the first version of Simplecast. I''d be in the podcasting space since 2012. We''d personally felt the challenges related to <a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/">starting a podcast</a>. We''d also seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNDgRcJYAEg">growing wave of demand</a> from new podcasters, especially after the Serial and Startup podcasts came out. This understanding helped us build a simple product that people <a href="https://transistor.fm/reviews/">really loved</a>.</p><p>In terms of self-funding a startup, many folks in their 40s-60s have accumulated a significant amount of savings, home equity, and investments that they can invest into the development of their product. </p><p>Jon and I each invested $5,000, and had main gigs that could fund Transistor''s development (until we were ready to go <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/30k/">full-time</a>).</p><p>Many of our best insights (and business ideas) come from <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/explore">exploration and experiences</a>. Older people have accumulated more of these!</p><p>Don''t believe the cliche that "startups are only for young people." Assuming you invest in the right things, your chances for success only go up as you get older.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
