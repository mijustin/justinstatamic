      <p>Technology can consume your life. As geeks, we're always "on": we have our smartphones with us 24/7, we're constantly checking Twitter and email, and we work even when we're not at the office.</p>
      <p><strong>But I'm not just a geek; I'm also a dad. </strong></p>
      <p>Even though the internet never takes a break, my kids need me to take a break from the internet. Here are some things I'm working on that I think will make me a better (geek) dad:</p>
      <h3>Put your ambition on hold</h3>
      <p><strong>I'd love to start something big:</strong> to fund my own startup, hire a team, and build an amazing product. <strong>But now's not the time.</strong> I don't think it's impossible to start a business while you have young children; but it's definitely a lot harder (I should know, I've tried). <strong>Startups require an enormous of amount of energy, time and focus. So do kids!</strong> You can't give 110% to your startup and have something meaningful leftover for your kids. Based on my own experience, and advice from others, I'm going to put my dream of running a bigger company on hold.</p>
      <h3>Choose your commitments carefully</h3>
      <p>There are so many opportunities in the tech community: I can go to conferences, sign up for workshops, take a course, contribute to open source, start a side-project, go to a meetup... The list is endless! Because I value my time with my family, I have to be selective. <strong>I can't go to everything; I can't even go to the <em>best </em>of everything</strong>. But what I can do is choose carefully, and really maximize my time once I'm there. So, if I'm going to a networking event, I set goals: Who do I want to meet? What do I want to accomplish? What items in the schedule should I attend, and what should I skip?</p>
      <p>The time of day is also important: as a dad, it's better if I can schedule work related commitments during work hours (9am-5pm, Monday-Friday). If an event requires overnight travel, and extends over a weekend, I'm less likely to attend.</p>
      <h3>Dock the phone</h3>
      <p>This one is hard! As soon as I get home, I'm trying to force myself to dock my phone, and not touch it (at least until after my kids are in bed). On weekdays 5:30pm-8pm is my window to enjoy my kids: t0 eat dinner with the family, do homework, do household chores, read them a story, and get them to bed. <strong>My iPhone is like a black-hole: it sucks me in whenever I'm around it.</strong> Too often I find myself staring at this little screen, while my son cheerfully describes his latest Pokemon battle. I don't think we need to spend every minute of our free time with our kids, but when we're engaged with them <strong>we do need to be present.</strong> The best way to accomplish this is to dock the phone when I get home.</p>
      <h3>Do geeky stuff with your kids</h3>
      <p>On a Saturday, my daughter and I were just hanging around the house, looking for something to do. "Dad, why don't you teach my how to build a web page?" What a great idea! Teaching my daughter HTML was geeky, and a lot of fun for both of us (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/squirrel">you can see her first web page here</a>). Last week my son wanted to learn how to touch type, so we downloaded a game and I started teaching him.</p>
      <p>There are lots of other ways to include your kids in geek culture: take them to a comic book store, build a LEGO robot, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy with them (with special emphasis on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/"><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></a>) .</p>
      <h3>Do non-geeky stuff with your kids</h3>
      <p><strong>Does the scene look familiar to you?</strong> The whole family is in the living room, and everyone is playing on their tablets, iPods, phones and laptops. <strong>We all need a break from tech.</strong> I work inside an office all day, and my kids are stuck in a classroom all day: <strong>we need to get outside</strong>. It's actually been challenging to find activities that we can do as a family. The litmus test for me is it has to be enjoyable for me <em>and</em> the kids. I don't want to be stuck on the sidelines while my kids play hockey or soccer, I want to be participating with them. We've found a good fit for us: in the winter we go skiing, and in the summer we bike or go to the beach.</p>
      <h3>It's about relationships</h3>
      <p>My kids love to take my phone and take pictures with it. This means when I dock my phone I'm importing hundreds of photos of walls, plants, their faces and... of me. I was looking at these lately and realized that in many of them I'm staring at a screen. Is that how I want my kids to remember me? <strong>My relationship with my wife and kids is how I'm ultimately going to judge the significance of my life.</strong> I think I'm a good geek; but I want to be a better dad.</p>
      <p>Hope this is helpful!</p>
