She said yes!<br>She signed up for @theKevinShen''s "Dream Studio" course, and she''s been loving it. Kevin and his team are really good at this stuff.</p><p>Yesterday, Lorinda cleared out my office &amp; started positioning my desk and existing camera according to the principles in @theKevinShen''s course<br>I was surprised at how much better the shots looked, even without adding anything new!<br>(The only light source here is an open window)</p><p>The goal is to upgrade everything to give me a consistent look (and stop using my window as my main light source).<br>One of the best parts of @theKevinShen''s course is it gives you equipment recommendations.<br>We''re going to try everything they recommended (camera, lenses, lights).</p>'
