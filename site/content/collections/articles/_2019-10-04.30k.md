    text: '<p>This is a good time to pause and take a breath. This whole journey has been a whirlwind: how does it feel to be here?<br></p><h2>How''d we get here?</h2><p>Jon Buda and I met in Portland, at the XOXO Festival, in 2014. We were both into podcasting: Jon had built an early podcast hosting tool, and I had a <a href="https://www.productpeople.tv/">podcast</a>. We ended up hanging out quite a bit that week. In the following years, we met up numerous times and even built a few small projects together.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017. Jon was working for Cards Against Humanity. They were about to launch a <a href="https://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">new podcast</a>, and he was building a tool on the side (called <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>) for them to use. We started talking about the idea of us teaming up and launching it to the public together.</p><p>We signed the partnership documents in February of 2018. That month we also made our first bit of revenue: $33.</p><p>Jon kept his full-time job and worked nights and weekends. I switched most of my focus to Transistor: doing marketing, inviting beta users, writing docs, and doing customer support.</p><h2>How fast did we grow?</h2><p>From the day we launched, we had nine months where MRR grew an average of 29% every month. That was way faster than we expected.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>Growth slowed during the summer, but now in the fall, we''ve bounced back. Currently, MRR is growing at 15% month-over-month.</p><h2>What causes revenue growth?</h2><p>Peldi once described the launch of Balsamiq this way:</p><blockquote><p>"It was like holding on to a rocket ship by my fingernails."</p></blockquote><p>When he announced his wireframing software, it was as if thousands of people had been <i>waiting for it</i>. In his Indie Hackers interview he said:</p><blockquote><p>"About eight months after launch, I had 3,000 customers. In the first six months of 2008, I generated about $165,000. It basically blew up in my face. Talk about product-market fit. It really sold itself from the beginning."</p></blockquote><p>I''ve been working in the software business since 2008. Before that, I worked in the snowboard industry for 7 years. I''ve watched hundreds of product launches.</p><p>What causes some products to grow revenue faster than others? <b>It all depends on how many people want it.</b></p><p><br></p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
