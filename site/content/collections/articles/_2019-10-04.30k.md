    text: '<p>This is a good time to pause and take a breath. This whole journey has been a whirlwind: how does it feel to be here?<br></p><h2>Transistor''s story so far</h2><p>Jon Buda and I met in Portland, at the XOXO Festival, in 2014. We were both into podcasting: Jon had built an early podcast hosting tool, and I had a <a href="https://www.productpeople.tv/">podcast</a>. We ended up hanging out quite a bit that week. In the following years, we met up numerous times and even built a few small projects together.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017. Jon was working for Cards Against Humanity. They were about to launch a <a href="https://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">new podcast</a>, and he was building a tool on the side (called <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>) for them to use. We started talking about the idea of us teaming up and launching it to the public together.</p><p>We signed the partnership documents in February of 2018. That month we also made our first bit of revenue: $33.</p><p>Jon kept his full-time job and worked nights and weekends. I switched most of my focus to Transistor: doing marketing, inviting beta users, writing docs, and doing customer support.</p><h2>How fast did we grow?</h2><p>From the day we launched, we had nine months where MRR grew an average of 29% every month. That was way faster than we expected.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>Growth slowed during the summer, but now in the fall, we''ve bounced back. Currently, MRR is growing at 15% month-over-month.</p><h3>What causes revenue growth?</h3><p>Peldi once described the launch of Balsamiq this way:</p><blockquote><p>"It was like holding on to a rocket ship by my fingernails."</p></blockquote><p>When he announced his wireframing software, it was as if thousands of people had been <i>waiting for it</i>. In his <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/085-peldi-guilizzoni-of-balsamiq">Indie Hackers interview</a> he said:</p><blockquote><p>"About eight months after launch, I had 3,000 customers. In the first six months of 2008, I generated about $165,000. It basically blew up in my face. Talk about product-market fit. It really sold itself from the beginning."</p></blockquote><p>I''ve been working in the software business since 2008. Before that, I worked in the snowboard industry for 7 years. I''ve watched hundreds of product launches. From what I''ve observed, what causes some products to grow revenue faster than others?</p><p><b>Revenue growth depends on how many people want what you''re selling, how easy they are to reach, and how much they want to spend. </b>The most important factor here is customer demand.</p><p>I realize this might sound trite. After all, don''t most folks understand that?</p><p>Maybe. It feels like we understand it in a "common sense" way, but don''t always act accordingly.</p><p>In my senior year of high school, my friend and I put on a rave in our hometown. When we opened the doors, hundreds of kids were lined up, ready to experience their first rave. They''d heard about these all-night dance parties but hadn''t been able to go to a bigger city to experience them. There was pent-up demand for what we were offering; tickets sold out.</p><p>The following year, my partner and I had been watching "Battle of the Year" videos on VHS, and we decided to hold a giant breakdance battle. We only sold a handful of tickets and ended up losing money.</p><p>What was the difference? Customer demand.</p><p>Like Balsamiq''s launch, my rave was a product people were willing to line up for. But the second time, demand wasn''t there.</p><p>For Transistor, and really for any product, we''ll continue to grow as long as there are more people who want to buy it from us.</p>'

    text: '<p>For most of the 80s and 90s, millions of people wanted to buy computers from Compaq. A <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/04/01/210990/index.htm">1996 Fortune headline</a> read:</p><blockquote><p>"With CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer at the wheel, Compaq is passing other PC makers. The future''s so bright he has to wear shades."</p></blockquote><p>But by the 2000s, slowing demand for PCs and competition from Dell caused Compaq''s growth to stagnate. They were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/hewlett-packard-in-deal-to-buy-compaq-for-25-billion-in-stock.html">acquired by HP in 2002</a>.</p><h2>What does $30k mean to us?</h2><p>For Jon and I, this new milestone means we''re continuing to build a business that can support us.</p>'
