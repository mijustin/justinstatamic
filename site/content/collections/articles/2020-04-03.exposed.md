    text: '<p><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/fight-amazon">Last week</a>, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>"<strong>We''re learning how frail the economic system is.</strong> Not only that, but we''re seeing how critical small business is to a healthy economy. Millions of people are out of work. It turns out, all those small businesses provide jobs for a lot of people."</p></blockquote><p><strong>This pandemic has left everyone exposed.</strong> Now, we can see how unprepared our government, economic, and healthcare systems were. A virus no larger than 0.2 microns punched our lights out. We''re on the ropes; dazed, and beaten up.</p><p>And it''s hard, even as I''m writing this, to know how to respond.</p><p><strong>On one hand, I''m cowering in fear</strong>; waiting for the next tsunami to hit. </p><p>Everyone keeps sharing this chart of unemployment insurance claims in the USA:</p>'

Plus, there''s <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/half-of-canadians-say-they-are-on-brink-of-insolvency-as-coronavirus-threatens-to-burst-countrys-consumer-debt-bubble">all that debt we''ve been amassing</a>.</p><p><strong>On the other hand, I want to start acting proactively.</strong> Is it weird to be thinking of the future now?</p><p>That''s all I can think about. How can we make sure, that when we come out of this, our society is better?</p><p>My friend <a href="https://pjrvs.com/">Paul Jarvis</a> replied to my <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/fight-amazon">last article</a>, saying:</p><blockquote><p>"The worst thing that could happen after all of this is if we go back to ''business as usual.''"</p></blockquote><p>We''ve seen what gets exposed when the tide goes out. When the tide comes back in, we can''t just forget everything we saw.</p>'

    text: '<p>The world needs to beat coronavirus; it''s a terrible disease, and it''s killing people. I hope scientists find a treatment soon.</p><p>But we''re not just battling a viral infection right now. We''re battling a societal ill that''s been incubating for a long time:</p><ul><li>It''s not OK that in an economic downturn, regular workers get hit the hardest, and take the longest to recover. (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/us-wages-could-take-4-to-5-years-to-recover-from-coronavirus-outbreak.html">Source</a>)</li><li>It''s not OK that the only restaurants that might survive this pandemic are the large chains. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/magazine/david-chang-restaurants-covid19.html">Source</a>)</li><li>It''s not OK that small businesses are being blocked by the big banks from getting get government COVID19 loans. (<a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/bofa-offers-emergency-loans-to-borrowers-first-freezing-out-depositors">Source</a>)</li></ul><p>It''s very likely that the richest people, and biggest companies, will gain the most in a post-COVID world. When you don''t have to worry about survival, you can afford to buy stocks at rock-bottom prices (and wait for the market to rebound).</p><p>That''s the world we live in: tragedy exacerbates inequality.</p><p>Lauren, at <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/">Strong Towns</a>, just sent me an email that said:</p><blockquote><p>"When the dust settles, we need to stop tilting the playing field against local businesses and start tearing down the barriers between them and success."</p></blockquote><p>Our society ain''t right.</p><p>And I don''t just want to complain about it. I want us to do something about it.</p><p>How can you and I help tear down barriers so that more indie businesses can succeed in the future? What can you and I do to help tilt the playing field in their favor?</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
