      <p>A series of bad business ideas can lead to a good idea.
      
      But it's unlikely that <i>working harder</i> on a mediocre business will transform it into something great.</p><p>I've worked on hundreds of business ideas that didn't work out. Exploring these ideas lead me to where I am today, but I'm glad I didn't stick with them.</p>

      What makes a business idea "bad?"
      
      _An idea is bad when it takes too much effort and time to achieve (and sustain) the desired results._

    text: '<p>For example, in my early twenties, I started a snowboard shop. I invested as much time and money as I could into the business. But each additional ounce of effort didn''t produce more revenue or better margins. The business itself was needy. It needed a huge amount of energy just to keep it afloat: rent paid, inventory ordered, employees scheduled. It was like treading water with a weight chained to my feet.</p>'

      <p>There's a danger in sticking with bad ideas for too long. You keep investing in the business, hoping that it will turn the corner, but it never really gains traction.</p><p>Bad ideas are <i>hungry</i>: they consume whatever energy, money, or time you throw at them, without giving you anything back.</p><blockquote><p>"This is the ultimate paradox with startups –&nbsp;<i>not yet</i>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<i>never</i>. Persistence is good but eventually becomes delusion." –&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/HolfolioBen/status/1296565549619699713">Ben Kinnard</a></p></blockquote><p><b>On the other hand...</b></p><p>Good business ideas sweep you up with their momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't have to carry them; they carry you.
      
      You apply the same effort to them, but they produce 100x the results.</p><p><br></p><p>At the very beginning, it's hard to tell if your idea is good or not.
      
      But you should feel the momentum increasing; like a river that starts slow and then gets faster.</p>
