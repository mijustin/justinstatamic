      <p>A series of bad business ideas can lead to a good idea.
      
      But it's unlikely that <i>working harder</i> on a mediocre business will transform it into something great.</p><p>I've worked on hundreds of business ideas that didn't work out. Exploring these ideas lead me to where I am today, but I'm glad I didn't stick with them.</p><p><b>What makes a business idea "bad?"</b></p><p><i>An idea is bad when it takes too much effort and time to achieve (and sustain) the desired results.</i></p>

      What makes a business idea "bad?"
      
      _An idea is bad when it takes too much effort and time to achieve (and sustain) the desired results._

      <p>&nbsp;Working <i>harder</i> and <i>longer </i>on these mediocre ideas didn't produce better results.&nbsp;</p><p>The danger is in sticking with bad ideas for too long.
      
      Bad ideas are only helpful in that they lead you to something else.</p><p>For me, it’s about desired results and the amount of effort that’s required to achieve and sustain those results.
      
      Example: a business that you need to make $100k/year but consistently only does $60k/year (despite multi-year investment).</p><p>Good ideas sweep you up with their momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't have to carry them; they carry you.
      
      You apply the same effort to them, but they produce 100x the results.</p><p>At the very beginning, it's hard to tell if your idea is good or not.
      
      But you should feel the momentum increasing; like a river that starts slow and then gets faster.</p>
