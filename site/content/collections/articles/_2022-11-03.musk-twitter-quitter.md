In nearly 14 years on the platform, Twitter''s had a net-positive effect on my life. I''ve met many friends there, had great conversations, been able to test out ideas and work in public, received helpful DMs and replies, and been able to promote different projects.<br></p><p>Now with Elon’s takeover, Twitter is in the hands of a man whose behavior I find reprehensible.
