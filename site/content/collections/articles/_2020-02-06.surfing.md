    text: '<p>Now, maybe more than ever, there are lots of people who aspire to build a software business.<br></p><blockquote><p>"Building a profitable remote SaaS business is the new American Dream." â€“ Tyler Tringas</p></blockquote><p>This desire is being motivated by a number of societal factors: the middle-class is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/may/17/america-geography-wealth-shrinking-urban-middle-class-visualised">shrinking</a>, commutes are getting <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/650061560/stuck-in-traffic-youre-not-alone-new-data-show-american-commute-times-are-longer">longer</a>, and real wages <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/50-years-of-us-wages-in-one-chart/">haven''t improved</a> in decades.</p><p>Individually, we''re driven by different things, but I''m sure many can resonate with Phil Duffy here:</p><blockquote><p>"Ultimately, my purpose in life is to work on projects I enjoy and to afford time with my family."</p></blockquote><p>We want a good life, and building a startup seems like the way to get it.</p><p>So there are more folks trying to build and launch products, which means there are a lot more people asking the question:&nbsp;</p><p><b>"How do I do this? How do I build a profitable business?"</b></p><p>Unlike the old American dream (go to college, get a good job, buy a house) this new aspiration is a lot harder to quantify.</p><p>Asking "how do I build a good business" is a lot more like asking "how do I become a good surfer?"</p><h2>Learning to surf for beginners</h2><p>Surfing is frustrating for beginners; largely because your first steps don''t look like surfing.</p><p>You spend a lot of time out of the water, getting familiar with the board, practising manoeuvres, learning to paddle, and observing waves.</p><p>Likewise, the first steps to launching a business won''t be "build a software product." Instead, you''ll start by working on your fundamentals.</p><p>If you''re learning something new, there''s always a lot of uncertainty at the beginning. One way to visualize this is with a hill chart (courtesy of <a href="https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/412-hill-charts">Basecamp</a>):</p>'
