    text: '<p>On an old episode of "The Business of Coding" podcast, Joe Stump asked this question:</p><blockquote><p>"A lot of engineers fall into the ''build it and they will come'' trap. Have you found that?"</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rk">Ryan King</a>, an engineer at CZI Science, replied:</p><blockquote><p>"People sometimes mistake <i>hard problems</i> (in the computer science sense) for <i>valuable problems</i> (in the business sense). Sometimes that venn diagram overlaps (like Google''s search algorithms). But there''s a number of cases where there''s a really valuable problem, but it''s not particularly hard on the technology side (AirBnB is an example of this)."</p></blockquote><p>The whole episode is excellent, with lots of practical tips for engineers and business folks alike:&nbsp;<a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/business-of-coding-business-of-coding-with-ryan-king">you can listen to the whole episode here</a>.</p>'
