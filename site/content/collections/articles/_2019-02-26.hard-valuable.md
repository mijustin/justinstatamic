    text: '<p>Product people are fixers. We''re always on the hunt for tasks that could be improved with better software.<br></p><p>When we see an opportunity to make something better, we can hardly resist. "This is something that needs to exist," we say confidently, "it will make people''s lives better!"</p><p>But as Jason Cohen points out in his <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/kung-fu.html">latest essay</a>, it''s not enough to find a paint point:</p><blockquote><p><i>Most of the time, real pain points addressed by great products are not a business</i>. Which is why founders confidently begin and are surprised when it fails.</p></blockquote><p>You might have discovered something that needs to be fixed, but that doesn''t mean people will pay for it.</p><p>Joe Stump (Digg, Sprintly) once asked this question:</p><blockquote><p>"A lot of engineers fall into the ''build it and they will come'' trap. Have you found that?"</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rk">Ryan King</a>, an engineer at CZI Science, replied:</p><blockquote><p>"People sometimes mistake <i>hard problems</i> (in the computer science sense) for <i>valuable problems</i> (in the business sense). Sometimes that venn diagram overlaps (like Google''s search algorithms). But there''s a number of cases where there''s a really valuable problem, but it''s not particularly hard on the technology side (AirBnB is an example of this)."</p></blockquote><p>The whole episode is excellent, with lots of practical tips for engineers and business folks alike:&nbsp;<a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/business-of-coding-business-of-coding-with-ryan-king">you can listen to the whole episode here</a>.</p>'
