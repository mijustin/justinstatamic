    text: '<p>Product people are fixers. Our goal is to improve people''s lives with software, so we''re always hunting for opportunities.</p><p>So when we see a problem that''s screaming to be solved, we can''t resist.</p><p>We''ll say: "This is something that needs to exist. People need it!"</p><p>But, finding a paint point, and fixing it, isn''t enough.</p><p>Jason Cohen points this out in his <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/kung-fu.html">latest essay</a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>Most of the time, real pain points addressed by great products are not a business</i>. Which is why founders confidently begin and are surprised when it fails.</p></blockquote><p>You might fix a problem people have, but that doesn''t you can do it profitably.</p><p>Jason''s point is reflected in <a href="https://makermag.com/2019/02/25/indie-makers-money/">this survey data</a>&nbsp;from MakerMag:</p><ul><li>50% of indie makers don''t earn any money from their products.</li><li>40% are earning some income.</li><li>Only 10% are making a full-time income.</li></ul>'

    text: '<p>Of the 50 projects he started, only five are currently active. That''s a 10% "success rate."</p><p>Likewise, Basecamp has started multiple products over the years:</p><ul><li>Basecamp Classic (2004)<br></li><li>Writeboard (2005)</li><li>Ta-da List (2005)</li><li>Backpack (2005)</li><li>Campfire (2006)</li><li>Highrise (2007)</li><li>Sortfolio (2009)</li><li>Breeze (2012)</li><li>Basecamp Next (2012)</li><li>Know Your Company (2013)</li><li>WeWorkRemotely.com (2014)</li><li>Basecamp 3 (2015)</li></ul><p>Currently, they''re only focusing on Basecamp 3. Everything else has been sold, spun off, or retired. That''s an 8% "success rate."</p><p>According to Jason Cohen, for a product to become a business you''ll need <b>numerous potential customers:</b></p><ul><li>Who realize they have the problem you''re solving.<br></li><li>You can reach at a reasonable cost.</li><li>You can convince to become customers</li></ul><p>And you have to do all of this, "at a profitable price, against existing market dynamics, and last for years."</p><p><br></p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br>@mijustin</p>'

    text: '<p><b>Aside: </b></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rk">Ryan King</a>, an engineer at CZI Science, notes that <b>hard technical problems </b>don''t necessarily translate into <b>profitable businesses.&nbsp;</b></p><blockquote><p>"People sometimes mistake <i>hard problems</i> (in the computer science sense) for <i>valuable problems</i>(in the business sense). Sometimes that venn diagram overlaps (like Google''s search algorithms). But there''s a number of cases where there''s a really valuable problem, but it''s not particularly hard on the technology side (AirBnB is an example of this)."</p></blockquote><p><i>This post was originally published on April 2, 2014.
