      <p>This is H1N1 scare is havoc on a parent's nerves.  Our 2 year-old son recently became sick with a serious fever.  It was the weekend, and the first question that entered my mind was: when should I take him to the hospital?</p>
      <p>Taking a sick child to emergency is the worst: putting them in an uncomfortable car seat, being jerked around during the drive, and then sitting in a crowded waiting room with other sick people is completely unsettling.  <strong>And if you think about it: it doesn't make sense</strong>.</p>
      <p>Why are unhealthy people driving themselves to the hospital?  Why are they driving at all?  Let's think of all the things that are prescribed when you're feeling ill.  You know: lots of rest, don't move around, no additional stress, stay away from <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967022-overview">other sick people</a>.  <strong>Driving yourself to the hospital exposes you to all these things.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>What happened to house calls? </strong>A mobile doctor, visiting a person in need of care <em>in their home</em> is a better way to do things.  Why are we having all the icky, bacteria infected <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967022-overview">people congregate together in one place</a>?  Let's stop this madness.  Let's give our doctors a cell phone, a Honda Fit, and the directions to our homes.  We'll all be better for it. </p>
