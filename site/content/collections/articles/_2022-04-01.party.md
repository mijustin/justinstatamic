    text: '<p>At a good party, new people can arrive and can bring a whole new level of energy. "The DJ is here!" "Jane just arrived!" "Hey everyone, I brought pizza!"</p><p>However, you can also feel it when you''re at a <em>bad</em> party. There''s a lack of energy; the atmosphere is dull, quiet, and lukewarm.</p><p>At a bad party, even the most electric, charismatic guest can''t bring the energy level up (no matter how hard they try).</p><p><strong>When you''re building a product in a market with strong demand, it feels like showing up at a good party</strong>.</p><p>The energy is already there: people are already actively searching for a solution.</p><p>In a good market, you don''t have to work super hard to convince people to buy your product, they already want it; they''re looking for it.</p><p>In fact, a good sign that you''re in a strong market is <em>people are excited when you show up</em>. You''re adding to the existing momentum.</p><p>One tactic is to look for an <em>existing party where the energy is waning</em>. This is what happened when <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a> showed up in the podcasting market; there hadn''t been a new hosting platform launched in years. When we showed up, people were excited to see us because we were bringing fresh energy to the space.</p><p>I''ve seen many other indie hackers replicate this tactic:</p><ul><li>Adam Wathan showed up at the CSS framework party (Bootstrap, Semantic UI) and gave them something new: <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>.</li><li>Taylor Otwell arrived at the PHP party and introduced a fresh framework: <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>.</li><li>Derrick Reimer came to a party Calendly had started in 2010, and brought new energy to it with <a href="https://savvycal.com/?r=justinj">SavvyCal</a>.</li><li>Jack and Paul decided to put up their own party tent in the analytics space. Pretty soon, a bunch of folks in Google Analytics'' tent were switching to <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/EJPZOB">Fathom Analytics</a>.</li><li>Brian Casel saw that Loom had a great party going since 2016, and joined with a different theme (<a href="https://zipmessage.com/">ZipMessage</a>).</li><li>Peter Suhm noticed the DJ at the form party (Typeform) hadn''t changed their tune in years, so he released <a href="https://www.reform.app/">Reform</a>.</li></ul><p>The energy of being in a strong market feels like arriving at a good party. You can feel it when it''s there, and you can also feel it when it''s absent.</p><p>Remember: you''re just one founder. You can''t singlehandedly turn a gathering with zero energy into something more exciting. If you notice you''re in a bad market (with low customer demand), your best move is to go somewhere else.</p><p>Find a good party!</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
