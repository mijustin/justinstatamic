    text: '<p><strong>Stand while you work.</strong> After months of experimenting at home, I recently built myself a "standing desk" for the office.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Building a desk that stands 40" tall required a trip to IKEA for the following components:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/90071168">VIKA AMON tabletop</a> - $49</li><li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/84609085">VIKA BYSKE adjustable stainless steel legs</a> - $20 x 4</li><li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/00101301">HUGO barstool</a> - $119</li><li><em><strong>Total cost: $248</strong></em></li></ul><p>I have a bar stool that I''ll sit on every hour or so to rest my legs.</p><blockquote><p>Why are you doing this? - <em>quote from my co-workers</em></p></blockquote><p>While I plan on going into this in more detail in a future post, I have two reasons:</p><ol><li>I have way more energy and focus when I stand and use a computer.</li><li><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-truth-behind-standing-desks-2016092310264">Sitting at a desk all day</a> is proven to cause deep vein thrombosis, obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol, herniated disks, poor posture, knee pain, muscle weakness, depression, slow metabolism, neck problems, backache, and death.</li></ol><p>The point isn''t necessarily to stand in one place all day: <strong>the whole point is NOT to sit.</strong> At a standing desk, you can choose your position: standing, leaning, sitting, standing with one foot up, etc... &nbsp;When you sit, you''re limited to one posture; when you stand, you have more flexibility.</p><p>Related links:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.ikeahackers.net/2011/01/wide-standing-desk.html">This desk is based on a similar design</a></li></ul>'
