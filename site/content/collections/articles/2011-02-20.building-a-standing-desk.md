      <p><strong>Stand while you work.</strong> After months of experimenting at home, I recently built myself a "standing desk" for the office.</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169" title="standing_02" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/standing_02.jpg" alt="How to build a standing desk from Ikea" width="590" height="424" /></p>

      <p>Building a desk that stands 40" tall required a trip to IKEA for the following components:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/90071168">VIKA AMON tabletop</a> - $49</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/84609085">VIKA BYSKE adjustable stainless steel legs</a> - $20 x 4</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/00101301">HUGO barstool</a> - $119</li>
      <li><em><strong>Total cost: $248</strong></em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have a bar stool that I'll sit on every hour or so to give my legs a rest.</p>
      <blockquote><p>Why are you doing this? - <em>quote from my co-workers</em></p></blockquote>
      <p>While I plan on going into this in more detail in a future post, I have two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>I find I have way more energy and focus when I stand and use a computer.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.nursingschools.net/blog/2011/02/14-proven-side-effects-of-sitting-all-day/">Sitting at a desk all day</a> is proven to cause deep vein thrombosis, obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol, herniated disks, poor posture, knee pain, muscle weakness, depression, slow metabolism, neck problems, back ache, and death.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The point isn't necessarily to stand in one place all day: <strong>the whole point is to NOT sit.</strong> At a standing desk you can choose your position: standing, leaning, sitting, standing with one foot up, etc... Â When you sit, you're limited to one posture; when you stand, you have more flexibility.</p>
