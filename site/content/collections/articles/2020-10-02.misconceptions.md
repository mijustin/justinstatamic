    text: '<p>Some folks seem to misunderstand what I mean when I say:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Go after a market with strong demand."&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Here''s what I''m <b>not</b> saying:</p><p>✘ "Build a product in a popular market."</p><p>✘ "Build a product in a market with lots of competitors."</p><p>✘ "Build a copycat when you notice a product doing well."</p><p>When I talk about a "market" I''m describing <i>the sum of demand</i> for a particular thing:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Number of potential customers</li><li>How much they spend</li><li>The frequency at which they buy</li><li>Their willingness to pay</li></ol><p><b>Building a new product is an enormous risk.</b> You''re risking your time and energy (which you''ll never get back), the investment of your own capital, and potentially lost wages.</p><p>So before you build a product, you want to see some <i>evidence of demand</i>. Essentially, you need to know:</p><blockquote><p>"How do I know that people want this thing, and will pay for it?</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, the evidence is that folks are already buying in a particular category, but they''re itching for a better solution. However, sometimes, the category doesn''t exist yet! In these cases, you might notice a group putting considerable effort into hacking together their own solution.<br></p><h3>What does customer demand look like?</h3><p>In the past, I''ve used examples to illustrate this concept. For example, in my town you can see evidence of "demand for coffee" because there are lineups outside many of the coffee shops.</p>'

      <p>Compared to alternatives (tea and milkshakes) there is more demand for coffee.</p><p>However, the point of this example isn't that you should go start a coffee shop. No!&nbsp;</p><p>My examples are <i>illustrative</i>, not prescriptive.</p><p>Likewise, when I use examples of successful companies it's for <i>context</i>.
      
      I'm not advising that you go and try to start a similar product in a similar market just because it worked for them!&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Look for momentum that's building, not a wave that's cresting.</b>
      
      Successful founders saw an opportunity at the right time and had the skills, connections, and resources to take advantage of it.
      
      Don't ride their wave, find your own!</p><h2>The founder is the surfer</h2><p>Without a wave, a surfer's skill is worthless.</p><p>However, when a surfer spots an oncoming wave, their ability to ride it depends on how good they are, their position in the water, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the skills, network, timing, and execution of the founding team <i>do</i> matter.</p>

      It doesn't matter how good of a surfer you are. **No wave? No surfing. **
      
      It doesn't matter how talented of a founder you are. **No demand? No business.**
