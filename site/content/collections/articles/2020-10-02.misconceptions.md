    text: '<p>Some folks seem to misunderstand what I mean when I say:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Go after a market with strong demand."&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Here''s what I''m <b>not</b> saying:</p><p>✘ "Build a product in a popular market."</p><p>✘ "Build a product in a market with lots of competitors."</p><p>✘ "Build a copycat when you notice a product doing well."</p><p>When I talk about a "market" I''m describing <i>the sum of demand</i> for a particular thing:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Number of potential customers</li><li>How much they spend</li><li>The frequency at which they buy</li><li>Their willingness to pay</li></ol><p><b>Building a new product is an enormous risk.</b> You''re risking your time and energy (which you''ll never get back), the investment of your own capital, and potentially lost wages.</p><p>So before you build a product, you want to see some <i>evidence of demand</i>. Essentially, you need to know:</p><blockquote><p>"How do I know that people want this thing, and will pay for it?</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, the evidence is that folks are already buying in a particular category, but they''re itching for a better solution. However, sometimes, the category doesn''t exist yet! In these cases, you might notice a group putting considerable effort into hacking together their own solution.<br></p><h3>What does customer demand look like?</h3><p>In the past, I''ve used examples to illustrate this concept. For example, in my town you can see evidence of "demand for coffee" because there''s lineups at many of the coffee shops.</p>'
