      <p>Note: this is the second post in my series on business lessons I learned while running a small retail business shortly after graduating university.  <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/business-lesson-go-where-the-people-are/">Click here to go to the first post</a>.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Here was another big mistake I made: I did too much planning, and only launched one "big" idea.</strong></p>
      <p>When I did my research, everything looked "fine" on paper.  My  area had more than enough target market; they had the money and the  demand for the goods.  I interviewed potential customers, all of whom  were excited about the idea of a local skateboard and snowboard shop.  I built my cash-flow based  on other shops in similar markets.</p>
      <p>But none of that planning ended up working, because all of the facts,  business theory, and analysis went out the window as soon as I started  selling real products.</p>
      <p><strong>What I should have done: preliminary research, followed by launching multiple "small" ideas to test the market.</strong></p>
      <p>Instead of planning for over a year, and then launching a big store, I  should have planned for a month and launched multiple test-runs.  I  could have tried selling skateboards out of my truck at the skatepark.   I could have rented a temporary space in the mall over Christmas.  I  could have tried home delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>All of this could have been accomplished with less time, less money, and less planning.</strong> Moving from the theoretical to actually trying to sell the product,  would have given me the data I couldn't accomplish doing other types of  research: will this work?  Is it worth doing?</p>
      <p><strong>Until you produce and sell something real, you can't really forecast what the response will be. </strong>Start small: build it and sell it as quickly as you can.</p>
