    text: '<p>Back in 2006 my wife and I made a deal...</p><p>We were 26 years old. We had two young kids at home. And we''d just closed our <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/business-lesson-go-where-the-people-are/">retail business</a>.</p><p>I almost had a breakdown that year.</p><p>So we made a decision: <strong>we wouldn''t start another business until our kids were all in school.</strong></p><p>It took a while (we had two more kids), but that time finally came this past January.</p><p>I''d waited ten&nbsp;years for this. It was time to make the jump to being a solopreneur, full-time.</p><h3>I had two big goals for 2016:</h3><ol><li>To replace most of my consulting income with&nbsp;product revenue. My initial goal was $120,000 for the year.</li><li>To start a new project called <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a>, which I kicked off with the <a href="https://megamaker.co/challenge"><em>2016 Maker Challenge</em></a>.</li></ol><p>Here''s how I did.</p><hr><h2>What worked?</h2><h3>Starting small</h3><p>I know some folks that quit their job and start building a business from scratch.</p><p>That works for some people, but personally, I''m glad I built up momentum&nbsp;over eight&nbsp;years:</p><ul><li>In 2008 I started this blog.</li><li>In 2012 I started the <a href="http://productpeople.tv">Product People podcast</a> with Kyle Fox.</li><li>In 2013 I released my first (tiny) <a href="https://buildandlaunch.net/book/amplification/">product</a> online.</li><li>In 2014&nbsp;I&nbsp;started the <a href="https://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a>.</li><li>In 2015 I released&nbsp;<a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>.</li></ul><p>My&nbsp;side-hustle&nbsp;had many&nbsp;benefits:</p><p>First, by focusing on "product people" for years, I''d been able to build a network, a reputation, and an audience.</p><p>By the end of 2015, I had&nbsp;9,085 <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">emails subscribers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;7,852 <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">Twitter followers.</a></p><p>I''d also slowly built-up side-project revenue:</p>'

      **Sidebar:**
      
      Here's why I'm giving this context: I'm seeing a lot of folks quitting their jobs and expecting to make $100k+ their first year as a solopreneur. 2016 was the first year I relied entirely on product income. Last year I was consulting full-time. The years before that I was an employee.
      
      Bootstrapping is a long journey in a single direction. Give it time!
      
      You also can't pay too much attention to other people's results (some of my peers did way more revenue than me this year, others did less).
      
      Success has many factors. Your results will vary. Stay focused on your customers, their struggles, and your response to those needs.

      <p>His encouragement was for me to stay focused on the topic of <strong>product marketing</strong>.</p><p>It turns out, from a business perspective, he was right.</p><p>I spent six&nbsp;months exploring my creativity, and doing crazy projects like the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/megamaker-ep05-put-a-little-maple-syrup-in-it">MegaMaker Burrito</a>.</p><p>But I didn't make any significant new revenue until I wrote <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt">Jolt</a>, re-released <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>, and doubled down on <a href="https://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a>.</p><p>I still believe that "<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/more-stuff-or-better-stuff/">the more stuff you make, the better stuff you'll make</a>."&nbsp;However, Buckbee's assessment was correct: from a business perspective, I should have been more focused.</p><p>In the beginning, <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> was concentrated&nbsp;on "artists, creatives, makers, artisans, who want to make more stuff."</p><p>Now, <a href="https://megamaker.co">the podcast</a> is focused on "software developers, designers, and entrepreneurs who want to earn an independent income online." This is a more natural fit for me, and my audience.</p><hr><h2>What I'd like to do better in 2017</h2><h3>Getting&nbsp;real:&nbsp;revenue - expenses = income</h3><p><a href="http://casjam.com/making-progress-profitably/">Brian Casel</a> does a good job of explaining how a solopreneur needs to think about salary:</p><blockquote><p>Getting your product business to a point where it can pay your salary is extremely difficult. I'm not talking about your "dream" salary. I'm talking about your baseline number that you need to cover your bills each month. When I was in my twenties, and single, that number was somewhere around $4,000/month. Now I'm in my thirties, married with a growing family, that number is closer to $10,000/month.</p></blockquote><p>With a family of 6, I&nbsp;need around $10,000 in monthly salary just to cover our bills.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/137735?v=6">$1xx,xxx</a> I earned in 2016 represents "gross revenue" for my business. But that&nbsp;wasn't my take-home pay. First, I had to pay business expenses.</p><p>What's left over is&nbsp;<strong>profit</strong>. That's what I can pay myself for living expenses, or keep in the business.</p><p>Overall in 2017, I'd like to increase the amount of profit the business makes.</p><h3>Increase revenue to $200,000</h3><p>One way to increase profit? Make more revenue. How am I going to do that?</p><p>First, I'm going to try to grow revenue for these existing products:</p><ul><li><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a></li><li><a href="https://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a></li></ul><p>These were my top performers in 2016.</p><p>To grow revenue in 2017, I'm going to be trying a few new projects:</p><ul><li><a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a></li><li>Book / course called "<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/freedom/">The Freedom Ladder</a>" (I'm speaking at <a href="http://www.microconf.com/starter/">MicroConf</a> on this topic)</li><li>Re-brand and re-focus <a href="http://remoteworkers.club">Remote Workers Club</a>?</li></ul><p>I'm going to commit to one new project at a time. My current focus is <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>.</p><h3>Decrease business expenses</h3><p>I posted my business expenses in the <a href="https://productpeople.club">Product People</a> forums, and people couldn't believe how much I was spending in different categories. I'm almost embarrassed to tell you. Here's a sample:</p><ul><li>Software and subscriptions: $5,000</li><li>Web hosting and cloud storage: $2,300</li><li>Coworking office: $3,000</li><li>Coffee (meetings, working from coffee shops): $2,500</li></ul><p>As a one-man shop, I know I'm paying too much for things like wireless, software subscriptions, and hosting. I'll be looking to reduce those bills this year.</p><p>I've already cut back on coffee. ;)</p><h3>Make a better newsletter</h3><p>I really like interacting <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">on Twitter</a>. It feels like some of my best stuff (thoughts, writing, questions) gets posted there.</p><p>But I've lost my mojo with <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">my newsletter</a>, and my mailing lists in general.</p><p>I'm not giving people an optimal experience. My plan is to focus my <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">main newsletter</a> on the same audience as <a href="https://megamaker.co">my podcast</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Software developers, designers, and entrepreneurs who want to earn an independent income online.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, I want my newsletter to conform to <a href="https://twitter.com/stephcrowder_">Steph Crowder</a>'s standard:</p><blockquote><p>"It makes me go do something to make my life better."</p></blockquote><p>I'm also thinking about trying some pretty radical ideas for 2017:</p><ul><li>What would happen if I&nbsp;<em>only</em> sent my newsletter to&nbsp;people who have bought something from me in the past?</li><li>What if new subscribers got 3 of my best newsletters for free, and then had to commit financially to continue?</li><li>Maybe, instead of weekly, I should only send a newsletter when I have a specific anecdote or tactic to share.</li></ul><p>For the B2B, startup, marketing crowd, I'll be focusing my efforts on a separate newsletter (likely under the <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> brand).</p><h3>A content funnel</h3><p>By the end of this year, I'd started experimenting more with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/techomic?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube channel</a>, and I discovered a new flow that worked well.</p><ol><li><a href="https://megamaker.co/live">Test out new material "live"</a> (like a comedian in a small club)</li><li>Refine that material into my newsletter</li><li>Refine that material into a <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker podcast</a> or edited video</li><li>Further refine that into a blog post</li><li>Cross-post that blog post to Medium</li></ol><p>I'd like to keep playing with this and improving it in 2017.</p><h3>Letting go</h3><p>I alluded to this earlier, but I'm reducing&nbsp;the number of ongoing projects I have.</p><p>I'll be sunsetting a lot of my side-projects.</p><h2>Other plans</h2><p>I am speaking at <a href="https://microconf.com">MicroConf</a> in Las Vegas this year. I'd like to do more <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/speaking/">speaking</a>&nbsp;(I spoke at the <a href="http://www.appsumo.com/SumoCon/">AppSumo</a> conference last year and had a blast).</p><p>I'd like to do more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOiwZOdjzxA/?taken-by=mijustin">skiing</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKzb0jDj-ds/?taken-by=mijustin">exploring</a> outside with my kids, and go on more dates with my wife!</p><p>Also, I haven't given up on public lists. ;) <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G0UX1NnTw5J1jiz3GxxN0RCJy5SGHJtDZAjPD6Bbx2s/edit?usp=sharing">Here's the new one for 2017</a>.</p><p>Cheers,<br>
