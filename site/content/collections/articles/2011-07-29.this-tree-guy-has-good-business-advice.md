      <p>The other day, I was picking my daughter up from a birthday party. The father of my daughter's friend is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborist">arborist</a>. He makes his living pruning and caring for trees, and he's owned his own business for 12 years.</p><p>During our conversation he told me his business story. His first few years in business were really tough. He'd grind and grind and grind, but wasn't earning a substantial amount of revenue.</p><p>And then, he found his solution. <strong>He changed his phone number.</strong></p><p>You see, up until then he'd focused his marketing efforts on his&nbsp;local market. Unfortunately, most the&nbsp;town's residents were&nbsp;retired farmers. They're&nbsp;DIYers:&nbsp;if their trees need pruning, cutting or care, they do it themselves.</p><p><strong>But 20 minutes away, there is a very affluent suburb.</strong>&nbsp;Most of the residents are executives. They don't have time to care for their trees; they <strong>need </strong>someone to do it for them, and they have the <strong>money</strong>&nbsp;to pay for it.</p><p>So, he switched his phone number to a number local to that suburb. He opened up a PO box there as well. And he started advertising in their yellow pages (this was 10 years ago), and their local paper.</p><p><strong>The result? </strong>Almost 95% of his revenue comes from this suburb.</p><p>Looking at it in hindsight, it seems obvious: <strong>go where people need your service, and have the money to pay for it</strong>. But so many of us&nbsp;keep grinding it out in the wrong conditions.</p><h3>Why your product isn't&nbsp;generating sales</h3><ol><li><strong>Wrong product </strong>- this is the worst case scenario. No one needs it (or wants it), and thus, they're not willing to pay for it.</li><li><strong>Good product, wrong market </strong>- this is a little harder to determine. How do you know if your product is good? <strong>Try a different market.&nbsp;</strong>My arborist friend switched to an affluent market, and got way better traction. Take your product to a different audience, and see if it works.</li><li><strong>Good product, wrong positioning.&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes you've chosen the right market, but you haven't positioned your product correctly. Is your product&nbsp;priced right for your audience? Is your marketing copy speaking their language? Does your product need&nbsp;different branding or design?</li><li><strong>Good product, no channels.&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes you have a product people want, but there are no strong distribution&nbsp;channels you can use to reach the customer.</li><li><strong>Good product, bad funnel.&nbsp;</strong>It's also possible that your process&nbsp;for taking people from&nbsp;<em>anonymous website visitors&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>paying customers</em> is broken. Maybe you're asking for the sale too quickly. You might need to create multiple touch points before someone buys. Maybe you have a freemium model, and you need to switch to a more traditional sales model.</li></ol><p>I've seen these tactics work in the software industry. One of my SaaS clients were&nbsp;toiling away&nbsp;in the B2C market for years. Their product was $19/month, and just wasn't profitable. <strong>They decided to change markets.</strong>&nbsp;They focused on B2B sales, cancelled their freemium plan, and raised the price to $99/month. Revenue took off.</p><p>Still grinding it out? Before you throw in the towel: it might be worth tweaking your product, and offering it to a new market.</p><p>Cheers,<br>
