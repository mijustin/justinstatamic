    text: '<p>This month we hit 25k in MRR, and this feels like a good time to pause, take a breath, and ask:</p><blockquote><p>"How the heck did this happen?"</p></blockquote><h2>Background on Transistor.fm</h2><p>Jon Buda and I met in Portland, at the XOXO Festival, in 2014. We were both into podcasting: Jon had built an early podcast hosting tool, and I had a <a href="https://www.productpeople.tv/">podcast</a>. We ended up hanging out quite a bit that week. In the following years, we met up numerous times and even built a few small projects together.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017. Jon was working for Cards Against Humanity. They were about to launch a <a href="https://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">new podcast</a>, and he was building a tool on the side (called <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>) for them to use. We started talking about the idea of us teaming up and launching it to the public together.</p><p>We signed the partnership documents in February of 2018. That month we also made our first bit of revenue: $33.</p><p>Jon kept his full-time job and worked nights and weekends. I switched most of my focus to Transistor: doing marketing, inviting beta users, writing docs, and doing customer support.</p><p><br></p>'
