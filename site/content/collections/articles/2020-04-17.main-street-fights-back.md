    text: '<p>In the past couple of weeks, I''ve focused my writing on the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/fight-amazon">Fight Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/exposed">We''ve Been Exposed</a>). Last week I said:</p><blockquote><p>Our society ain''t right. And I don''t want to just complain about it, I want us to do something about it. What can we do to help tilt the playing field, so it''s fair for small businesses?</p></blockquote><p>The problem is that the cards are stacked against small businesses.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>This week, the stimulus package that was supposed to help small businesses in the USA <b>ran out of money</b>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/politics/coronavirus-small-business-program.html">The New York Times</a> reported that the stimulus didn''t reach the small businesses that needed it most (restaurants, bars, and hotels).&nbsp;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/14/coronavirus-law-congress-tax-change/">Washington Post</a> noted that "more than 80 percent of the benefits of a tax change tucked into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/senate-stimulus-bill-coronavirus-2-trillion-list-what-is-in-it/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank">coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;will go to those who earn more than $1 million annually."</li><li>Meanwhile, megacorporations like Amazon are benefitting massively from society''s current quarantine. The value of Jeff Bezos'' wealth has increased by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic">$24 billion</a> since the beginning of the pandemic.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/amazon-coronavirus-public-utility-workers#maincontent"></a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/amazon-coronavirus-public-utility-workers#maincontent">From the Guardian</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The Covid-19 outbreak hasn’t slowed Amazon down. Quite the opposite: even as other businesses have downsized or shuttered, Amazon has proved remarkably well-placed to capitalise on these new circumstances, with customers spending a reported $11,000) a second on its products and services.</p></blockquote><p>Despite their surging sales, Amazon decided that now was a good time to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/amazon-slashes-commission-rates-for-affiliate-program.html">cut their affiliate rates</a>. Thousands of small businesses rely on Amazon commission checks for their livelihood. This affects folks like my friend Matt:</p>'

    text: '<p>Now we can see the danger of letting Amazon control all the distribution. Once they own the whole pie, "it is in their interest," as <a href="https://thisten.co/ltmam">Seth Godin</a> says, "to pay workers and small businesses less."</p><h2>How the system keeps us powerless</h2><p>Most entrepreneurs are pursuing the "American dream." The idea is that we, as individuals, can build our own little silo and create our own wealth. It''s rugged individualism: each individual competes against each other, hoping to get a piece of the pie.</p><p>But it''s a lie.</p><p>We''re not competing for a piece of the pie, we''re fighting for the crumbs.</p><p>And it''s in the interest of the big platforms to keep this happening. Again, Seth Godin:</p><blockquote><p>If you own the factory, you have something that workers don''t have – which is the Means of Production. So if you can pit workers against each other, and they will bid down and down to get the job, you come out ahead.</p></blockquote><p>These days, it''s not so much owning the factory that gives you power; it''s owning the Means of Distribution. This is Amazon''s big strength. They have the:</p><ul><li><b>physical distribution:</b>&nbsp;their warehouses, distribution centers, and logistics,</li><li><b>software platform:</b>&nbsp;their storefront, cloud architecture, search engine, and traffic.</li></ul><p>Since 1994, Amazon has invested billions of investor money (and most of its profits) into creating the world''s largest marketplace. They''ve become the platform where buyers and sellers do commerce.</p><p>However, the effect of this centralization of power is the same: Amazon can "pit small businesses against each other." They''re happy to keep us all occupied, competing against each other. And they''ll continue to squeeze their merchants and workers, by paying them less and less, because they own "the platform where commerce happens."</p><h2>How we fight back</h2><p>When we are divided, Main Street businesses, solopreneurs, and bootstrappers will continue to scramble for crumbs, while big corporations gobble up the pie.</p><p><b>Maybe what we need is a new wave of collaborative commerce</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>A single unconnected node isn''t nearly as powerful as a diverse, interconnected, network of independent merchants. The internet gives indie entrepreneurs the infrastructure needed to generate the kind of network effects that can compete at scale with companies like Amazon.</p><h3>Platforms that enable collaborative commerce</h3><p>We''ve already seen this work with open source projects, like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>WordPress made publishing a blog, website, or online store accessible to everyone. The underlying software is free. Anybody can contribute to the software, and add-ons that make WordPress more powerful are abundant (and low cost). This means an independent site like <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/">Apartment Therapy</a>, led by Maxwell Ryan, is empowered to use the same publishing platform as a giant media company like TIME Inc.</li><li>Laravel and Ruby on Rails are programming frameworks that make it easier for small dev shops to have a big impact. These frameworks allow Jon Buda and I to run <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor.fm</a> as a two-person company, even though some of our competitors have teams of 100. They also level the playing field economically. Jon and I bootstrapped Transistor with our own money; Rails and Laravel help us to keep our development costs low even while we compete against startups with millions of dollars in funding.</li></ul><h3>Communities that enable collaborative commerce</h3><p>Traditional professional associations, chambers of commerce, and unions have a few problems:</p><ul><li>Invariably, they become obsessed with increasing membership, because their administrators need the funds to pay their salaries.</li><li>They''re often inwardly focused, and aren''t very innovative.</li><li>Technically, grassroots members have a "vote," but in practice, the top leadership makes all the decisions.</li></ul><p>But today, the internet has given us ways to collaborate that don''t require a big organization to run.</p><p>Online communities that run on Slack, Discord, forums, Reddit, and GitHub have enabled groups of people to join together, and collaborate.&nbsp;</p><p>These online communities still require leadership, but require far fewer people to run.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://megamaker.co/">MegaMaker</a>, a private community for bootstrappers, has 606 members. It''s moderated by myself, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonfriesen">Jon Friesen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenRyles">Helen Ryles</a>. And every day, indie entrepreneurs from around the world connect on our Slack and Discourse forums. We give each other technical and marketing help and connect folks to the resources they need.</p>'
