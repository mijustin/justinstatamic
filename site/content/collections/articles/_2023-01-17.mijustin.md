    text: '<p>When I ask <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> the question: "Why have governments outsourced the collection of sales tax to businesses?" it answers:</p><blockquote><p>Governments typically outsource the collection of sales tax to businesses because it is more efficient and cost-effective than having government agencies collect the tax directly. Businesses are already collecting money from customers as part of their sales transactions, so they can simply remit a portion of that money to the government regularly. This approach also puts the burden of compliance on businesses rather than on government agencies. Additionally, businesses have a vested interest in ensuring that the correct amount of tax is collected, as they can face penalties for noncompliance.</p></blockquote><p>In most regions of the world, it''s taken for granted that companies are required to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax. This system clearly benefits governments: they have externalized the costs of collecting their taxes onto the shoulders of business owners.</p><p>We''re already asking a lot of business owners; why are we burdening them with sales tax collection?</p><p><br></p>'
