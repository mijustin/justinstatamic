    text: '<p>I have a soft spot for young parents, who are also indie hackers.</p><p>Starting a business when you have kids (especially infants!), and very little capital, is a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1399050069895106563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole other level of difficulty</a>.</p><p>It‚Äôs the ‚Äúhardest hard mode;‚Äù especially for bootstrappers.</p><p>But, I also know how transformative a high-margin, profitable, indie-SaaS can be for family. For me personally,&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transistor</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1401636368283963392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changed everything</a>. Specifically: having more money for my family has been empowering.</p><p><strong>So from the beginning,&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ramen.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Joshua''s story</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;resonated with me.</strong>&nbsp;I''ve been there. I know what it''s like to be 27, with two kids, trying to make ends meet.</p><p>Over the years, I''ve kept up with Josh, and have tried helping him out whenever I can.</p><h1>What happened next</h1><p>Fast forward to 2021. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have enough money to start investing. I figured: "I can probably invest in one company this year."</p><p>But I don''t want to be a passive investor; I want to invest in a person and really collaborate with them.</p><p>I instantly thought of Josh.</p><p>I reached out, and was initially going to invest in Upscribe (email newsletters).</p><p>But the more I thought about it, the more I felt like there was an adjacent opportunity where we could really shine.</p><p>There are a number of trends coalescing right now:</p><ul><li>The overall creator economy</li><li>Paid subscriptions (email newsletters, private podcasts)</li><li>Community sites (Circle,&nbsp;<a href="https://playgroup.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playgroup</a>, Indie Hackers, Dev.to)</li><li>People adding community to their newsletter, SaaS, podcast, etc.</li></ul><p>I''ve been swimming in these waters for awhile. I started MegaMaker in 2013 (before Indie Hackers, WIP, and Nomadlist existed). As a community, we''ve felt all the pain points that come with building a membership-driven site.</p><p>Most folks who run membership programs string together a bunch of different services to make it work:</p><ul><li>WordPress, Squarespace (for the marketing site and member pages)</li><li>Memberful, Patreon, Gumroad (registration and payment)</li><li>Community Box (member directories, profiles)</li><li>MailChimp, Substack (member newsletters, email onboarding, content)</li><li>Discourse, Slack (for member posts and chat)</li></ul><p><strong>For Josh and I, building a better membership platform was a category where we felt we could shine.</strong></p><p>In May, Josh began building a brand new app which we''re calling <a href="https://meeps.app">Meeps</a>.</p><p>Here''s a demo video:</p>'
