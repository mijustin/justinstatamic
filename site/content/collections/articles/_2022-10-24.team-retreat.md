    text: '<p>Planning a remote team retreat can be a daunting task, so we wanted to share our learnings in the hopes that it’ll be helpful for other remote teams out there.</p><p>Here are six of our recommendations for planning remote team retreats:</p><ol><li>Chose the right location</li><li>Don’t put too much into the schedule</li><li>Have one main discussion topic per day</li><li>Plan group activities and outings</li><li>Meet some of your customers</li><li>Have fun</li></ol><h2>Choose the right location</h2><p>The first step is to choose an awesome location that’s accessible to everyone on your team. </p><p>We chose Montreal because it was roughly the midway point between myself (in British Columbia) and Helen (in the UK). Jon is in Chicago, and Jason is in Ohio, so Montreal was a fairly quick plane ride for them.</p><p>But we also chose Montreal because it’s an incredibly vibrant city, full of french-Canadian culture, with lots to see and do.</p><p>We stayed at the <a href="https://www.epikmontreal.com/">Hotel Epik</a>, in the heart of Old Montreal. Old Montreal is a historic neighborhood close to the harbor. It’s full of charming cobblestone streets, quaint cafes, and lovely boutiques.</p>'

    text: '<p>There are plenty of touristy activities in Old Montreal, like visiting Notre Dame Basilica and the Old Port. But we also loved just walking around and exploring the neighborhood. We stumbled upon a hidden speakeasy, ate some of the best food of our lives, and even took a boat tour to the South Shore.</p>'

We wanted to have enough time to catch up with each other and explore the city.</p><p>Our team retreat schedule was really relaxed: </p><ul><li>9 am – wake up, have breakfast</li><li>10 am –&nbsp;everyone meets up to work together</li><li>11 am – group discussion </li><li>12:30 pm – lunch </li><li>2:00 pm – nap, alone time</li><li>6:30 pm – dinner together</li><li>8:00 pm – hang out as a group</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This left plenty of time for us to explore the city, grab lunch together, and just hang out in our meeting room.</p><p><br></p><h2>Plan some group activities and outings</h2><p>While we wanted to leave plenty of time for everyone to do their own thing, we also wanted to make sure we had some time to bond as a team.</p><p>So, a few members of our team planned a few group outings:</p><p>- Attending a Montreal Canadiens NHL hockey game</p><p>- Going to a Moderat concert together</p><p>- Taking a boat ride tour of the harbor</p><p>- Touring through the Notre Dame Cathedral</p><p>- Watching a movie together</p><p><br></p><p>Later, when we reviewed the retreat, it was these shared experiences that became our highlights.</p><h2>Meet some of your customers</h2><p>One of my main goals was to meet with as many of our customers who lived in Montreal as we could.</p><p>I was blown away by how many people were willing to meet with us. There’s no substitution for seeing the folks who use your product face-to-face. It’s incredibly motivating to hear how they’re using your product, and the feedback we gained from these meetings was invaluable.</p><p>If you can, try to schedule a few customer meetings into your retreat schedule. It’s a great way to get feedback and connect with your customers on a personal level.</p><h2>Have fun!</h2><p>Last but not least, make sure you have fun!</p><p>Our team spends most of our time in Slack, working on projects, and meeting over Zoom.</p><p>It was lovely to be able to enjoy our time together. The goal of a retreat is really to build a personal connection with your teammates. The best way to do that, is to have fun experiences together.</p><p>At one point, Jason and I went for a run together. Just running along the water, and doing a short 30-minute jog, gave us a shared experience that you just don’t get remotely.</p><p>Overall, our first team retreat was a big success. We returned to our homes feeling more connected than ever, and with a renewed appreciation for the work we do together.</p><p>We hope these tips are helpful for you as you plan your own remote team retreat. If you have any other tips, please share them in the comments!</p>'
