      <p>Yesterday, I published the last episode of <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/?utm_source=justinjackson&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=endofanera">Build &amp; Launch</a>'s first season.</p>
      <p>It's been an incredible ride.</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <p>In the past month, I've launched 4 personal projects:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>the <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/review">podcast</a> itself</li>
      <li><a href="https://gum.co/producthunt/mailinglistfeb28?utm_source=justinjackson&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=endofanera">The Product Hunt Handbook</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.networkeffects.me/?utm_source=justinjackson&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=endofanera">Network Effects</a>: a web app for notifying groups via SMS</li>
      <li><a href="https://gum.co/productify/mailinglistfeb28?utm_source=justinjackson&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=endofanera">Productify</a>: make a membership site on WordPress using Gumroad</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Building and launching a new project every 7 days taught me the value of <em>starting now, and starting small</em>. Shipping is addictive.</p>
      <p>Here are a few other lessons I learned during the process:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Partner up</strong> - this year, I've been forcing myself to quit being a lone wolf, and find people to partner with. When I partnered with <a href="http://carlalexander.ca/?utm_source=justinjackson">Carl</a> and <a href="http://code-ninja.org/?utm_source=justinjackson">Marty</a>, the end result was far better than what I could have done on my own. Two heads are better than one. ;)</li>
      <li><strong>Set a deadline</strong> - the Build &amp; Launch challenge is to create a new project every 7 days (start on Friday and ship on Thursday). Having that hard deadline is really motivating. Setting aside each week to focus on one thing was also helpful.</li>
      <li><strong>Share the process</strong> - I've been sharing everything (including my bumps and bruises) with this mailing list and <a href="http://buildandlaunch.net/?utm_source=justinjackson&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=endofanera">the podcast</a>. People love being a part of the journey.</li>
      <li><strong>The only thing that matters, is the work</strong> - when you're building a product, there are a lot of things you can spend your time on: tweeting, answering email, fiddling with analytics. With only 7 days for each project, I quickly learned that the only thing that mattered was sitting down <em>and doing the work</em>. No procrastinating. Building a product is like pushing a rock uphill: your whole focus should be getting that rock to move a little farther. Everything else is a distraction.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The best part about doing the podcast was the amazing response I got from listeners. <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrettABrooks/status/571805313441009664">Tweets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/isosmrt/status/571789129106649088">like</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rydama/status/570688376329924608">these</a> kept me inspired to keep making the show.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm already getting ready for season 2!</strong> In the meantime, I'll spend the next two episodes answering <strong>your</strong> questions. Have a question about one of the projects we launched? Trying to figure out how you can build and launch your own thing? <a href="mailto:words@bizbox.ca">Email me</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/mijustin">get me on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>Thanks for being a part of the journey. Now, let's go make some stuff.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
