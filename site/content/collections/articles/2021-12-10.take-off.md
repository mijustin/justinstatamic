    text: '<p>We think we should be rewarded for the effort, resources, and time we invest in a project. </p><p>Unfortunately, markets don''t work this way. </p><p>In business, the amount of reward you get (revenue) is based mostly on demand: </p><p><em><strong>"How much do people want what you''re selling?"</strong></em></p><p>The "shape of demand" differs from product to product. This is often noticeable once you''ve launched multiple projects.</p><p>For example, Francesco and his team launched <a href="https://mailbrew.com/?aff=mijustin">Mailbrew</a> (to much fanfare) in March of 2020. They go press on 9to5Mac, MacSparky, Reddit and Hacker News.</p><p>And then, 9 months later, the same team launched <a href="https://typefully.app/">Typefully</a>.</p><p>Mailbrew had a big head start (Typefully didn''t start earning revenue until June 2021), <strong>but Typefully now earns more revenue</strong>:</p>'

    text: '<p>This can be frustrating for makers because, regardless of the amount of work we''ve put in, some products just get better traction, faster.</p><p>Why? </p><p><strong>Traction is more connected to underlying demand than founder effort.</strong></p><p>Another example:</p><p>Peter Suhm worked on Branch (a WordPress product) for a long time. He spent <a href="https://outofbeta.fm/episodes/11-the-nomenclature">years trying to get traction</a>.</p><p>Then, he and a co-founder built <a href="https://www.reform.app/">Reform</a> (a Typeform alternative) in a few months. <a href="https://twitter.com/petersuhm/status/1417933862076878851">Reform quickly eclipsed Branch in revenue</a>.</p><p>Effort in â‰  revenue out</p><p>Some types of products just have more demand!</p>'
