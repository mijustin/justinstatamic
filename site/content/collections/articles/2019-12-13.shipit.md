      <p>Someone on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">my email list</a>&nbsp;asked me: "How do you get over perfectionist tendencies, and put stuff out there?"</p><p>The first thing&nbsp;out of my head was:</p><blockquote><p>"You don't really learn until you ship."</p></blockquote><p>You can tinker with something, and try to get it perfect. But until you get real-world feedback on it, you won't really know how valuable it is. The longer you sit on a project, the more it festers. Putting it out in public, and seeing people's response, is what gives your work oxygen.</p><p><strong>The other thing I've learned:</strong> the more frequently you ship, the easier it gets. Shipping small updates, more frequently, is like putting in your reps at the gym.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're the type of person&nbsp;</p><p>Give yourself a goal: "I'm going to make&nbsp;<em>this thing&nbsp;</em>by&nbsp;<em>this date</em>." Go do it. And then do it again, and again, and again. That's what's worked for me.</p><p>Cheers,<br>
