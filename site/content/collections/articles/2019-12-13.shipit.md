      <p>Someone on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">my email list</a>&nbsp;asked me: "How do you get over perfectionist tendencies, and put stuff out there?"</p><p>The first thing&nbsp;out of my head was:</p><blockquote><p>"You don't really learn until you ship."</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>I can tinker with something, try to get it perfect, but until I get feedback, the idea has no value. The longer I sit on a project, the more it festers.&nbsp;The&nbsp;drive to learn&nbsp;and improve is what moves me forward.</p><p>Ultimately, I want to figure out: "what does my audience truly need?" The only way to figure that out, is to show them something I've made.</p><p><strong>The other thing I've learned:</strong> the more frequently you ship, the easier it gets. Shipping is a muscle like anything else. Actually, for me it's more like oxygen. I need to put something out every day, or I'm just not breathing.</p><p>Give yourself a goal: "I'm going to make&nbsp;<em>this thing&nbsp;</em>by&nbsp;<em>this date</em>." Go do it. And then do it again, and again, and again. That's what's worked for me.</p><p>Cheers,<br>
