      <p>John Doerr, a venture capitalist, is credited with saying:&nbsp;</p><p><i>"Ideas are easy. Execution is everything."</i></p><p>I disagree.</p><p><b>If ideas are so easy, why are most business ideas so bad?&nbsp;</b>The opportunity you choose to focus on matters a lot.</p><h2>Why your idea matters</h2><p>The market you choose, and the idea that you focus on, are the most important business decisions you’ll make. They determine your trajectory.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, how you execute is a part of that, but your ceiling for success is set by the idea itself.</p><p>The risk with overemphasizing “execution” is it deludes people into thinking that if they work hard enough they can make any idea successful. It’s just not true.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t believe me, go browse old listings on Product Hunt. 
      
      You’ll see page after page of beautifully executed products that never achieved meaningful traction.
      
      There have been thousands of ideas posted; most failed.&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of tech people who are skilled at building software but struggle to build good software businesses.
      
      The difference is in the quality of their ideas.</p><h2>Finding a good idea is not easy</h2><p><br></p><p><br></p>
