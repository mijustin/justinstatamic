      <blockquote><p>“Just do it.” I feel people like to talk about their ideas and they go to networking events and they “look into” it and they sit on the sidelines, but they never actually do anything. I always find I get itchy when I have an idea and I just need to go and do it, so I will just do it. I think that's kind of key. If you’re not going to start anything, nothing’s going to happen.</p>
