      <p>You might be a programmer, designer, or manager; <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">but do you ever daydream about other careers?</strong></p>
      <p>I often imagine what it'd be like to be a <strong>restauranteur</strong> or a <strong>rock star</strong>. My daydream is always about how I'd promote that business in unique ways. Here are a few of my ideas:</p>
      <h3>Rockstar</h3>
      <p>I was thinking about the <em data-redactor-tag="em">jobs</em> we hire music to do. When I'm working out, I'm using music to pump me up. At work, I want tunes that keep me focused. If I'm at a club (rare, now that I'm 36, married, with 4 kids) I'm looking for jams that will get out on the dance floor.</p>
      <p>What's the biggest challenge with being a musician? It's hard to make a living off $0.99 downloads on iTunes (or pennies on Spotify).</p>
      <p>But what if musicians sold music in packages for specific <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1952"><em data-redactor-tag="em">jobs to be done</em></a>? For example:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Morning workout: </strong>every morning, you get a new adrenaline pumping tune. It comes in multiple formats: music only, narrated aerobics, and narrated weight lifting. The narration also helps you decide what kind of exercise you'll be doing that day.</li>
      <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Pomodoro streaming: </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">your office probably wouldn't pay for Spotify. But your boss <em data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="em">might </em><span class="redactor-invisible-space">pay for</span> service that helps keep employees more focused. My Pomodoro channel would give employees 25 minutes of ambient music, followed by 3-5 minutes of "break time" tunes. (More on Pomodoro <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">here</a>).<br />
      </span></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pub / Coffee shop</h3>
      <p>The pub on the TV show <em data-redactor-tag="em">Cheers</em> had a great slogan: "Where everybody knows your name." <span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">The truth is, what we really want is for the<strong> owner, barista, and bartender</strong> to know <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">our</strong> name.</span></p>
      <p>I had family in town last week. We wanted to go out for a late dinner, but everywhere was closed. I texted my friend Eric who owns <a href="http://www.stationbbq.com/">Station BBQ</a> (for those who listen to my podcast, this is where we did the infamous MegaMaker Burrito). I asked him if he could keep his kitchen open for us. He said: "Absolutely!" When we arrived, he said: "Hey Justin! I saved you a special table." The whole staff welcomed us and were genuinely happy to have us. Eric brought the whole table a special bourbon to try. I felt like a VIP.</p>
      <p>If I owned a pub, coffee shop or restaurant I'd take this one step further. I'd find customers who were natural cheerleaders, and give them a gold business card. On the card, I'd have my personal cell number with the words: "if you ever need anything, just call me." I'd also instruct these customers to show it to staff if I wasn't ever around. Anytime my team saw the card, they'd know <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">who</strong> they were serving: a VIP.</p>
      <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">In the service industry, word of mouth is king. When your best customers feel like bigwigs, they'll tell everyone they know about your place.</span></p>
      <h3>What do you daydream about?</h3>
      <p>What would you do to disrupt those industries? I'd love to hear about it. ;) You can message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/mijustin">Instagram</a>, or <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/">my newsletter</a>.</p>
