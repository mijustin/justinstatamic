    text: '<h2>Two emails I received</h2><p>Initially, I wasn''t sure I was going to talk about this on stage in New York.

But as I spoke, I could tell that it was resonating.</p><p>After the talk, I had dozens of folks approach me to tell me their stories. They told me: "I''ve felt that way too."</p><p>When the video from the talk was published, I was apprehensive about sharing it too much. It''s vulnerable talk.
