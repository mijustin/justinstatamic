    text: '<p>In startup land, there is a ton of "common wisdom" that gets repeated.&nbsp;For example, take this famous quote from Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn):</p><blockquote><p>"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you''ve launched too late."</p></blockquote><p>At face value, this <b>feels</b> right. It''s likely that founders are quoting Reid at this very moment: "C''mon folks! Let''s ship this now!"</p><p>But what if the common wisdom is wrong?</p><p><b>Even worse: what if it''s making us miss out on good opportunities?</b></p><p>We often internalize these sayings without thinking critically about them.</p>'
