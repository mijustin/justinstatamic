      <p>A lot of people want to be the next Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

      <p><strong>What part of Zuckerberg's success do they want?</strong> Maybe it's the money. If you're struggling to pay the bills, Mark's billions are tantalizing. But once you get past $200k, $500k, $1 million a year... does the money still motivate you?</p>
      <p>It's also odd that the same names keep coming up: Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Page.</p>
      <p><strong>Why not Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen?</strong> He's worth $9.4 billion, and his family started LEGO. There's also Carlos Slim Helu. He's worth more than Zuck ($72.9 billion). Have you heard of Ingvar Kamprad? He founded Ikea. Nobody seems interested in them.</p>

      <p><strong>There's something we want more than money.</strong></p>
      <hr />
      <p>Imagine you're walking down the street. You're about to duck into a coffee shop when someone stops you. Nervously, they whisper:</p>
      <blockquote><p>I just want to say, I really admire your work.</p></blockquote>
      <p>How does that make you feel?</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Now imagine you're at your high school reunion. An old acquaintance approaches and asks: "So what are you doing now?"</p>
      <p><strong>Which would you rather be: a janitor or business owner?</strong></p>
      <p>Statistically most folks will choose "business owner." Is this because an entrepreneur is wealthier than a janitor? It goes deeper than that. Let's do the exercise again, but with these two choices:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Funeral director</li>
      <li>College professor</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Funeral directors make more money, but "college professor" feels more appealing, doesn't it?</p>
      <p>Even though Carlos Helu has a greater net worth, the public is more interested in Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
      <p>We want something greater than wealth: <strong>we want to be known</strong>.</p>

      <h3>What's your status?</h3>
      <p>I'm fascinated by how our culture defines success.</p>
      <p>Sociologists tell us that humans use power, property and prestige to measure status. Of the three, our culture is increasingly focusing on prestige.</p>
      <p>The recent phenomena of internet fame is a good example. We join Instagram hungry for "likes." We post on Snapchat, hoping for views. Getting "recommends" on Medium boosts our ego. We aspire for retweets.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"We want strangers to want to meet us, as much as we want to meet a famous stranger."</p>

      <h3>Is it bad to want to be liked?</h3>
      <p>I don't buy this nonsense that being well known isn't helpful. I've noticed a direct correlation. The more people that appreciate my work, the more opportunities I seem to get. It's disingenuous to say that stature doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>It's not "bad" to want to recognition. That's normal. What's unhealthy is the <em>desperation</em>:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>teens desperate for <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/573/status-update">compliments on Instagram</a></li>
      <li>authors desperate to have a best seller</li>
      <li>software entrepreneurs desperate to be #1 on Product Hunt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's a viscous cycle. Everyone is focused inward. There's less outward praise, which results in more people being starved for attention.</p>
      <p><strong>There's a huge opportunity here.</strong> While everyone else is chasing internet fame, you can be different. <em>You can focus on understanding people better.</em></p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p><strong>Because human beings are hungry for connection.</strong> Deep down, they want to be understood.</p>
      <p>The better you understand people, the better you'll be able to serve them. You'll create better art, write better books, and build better software.</p>

      <p>Self-focus doesn't produce good work. Use your work to care for others.</p>
      <p>Don't try to be well known; try to know other people well.</p>
