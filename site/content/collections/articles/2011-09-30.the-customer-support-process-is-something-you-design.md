      <p>When you build a website or app, you <em>design </em>it.  This means making sketches and getting feedback, building prototypes and <strong>having debates on what will be really important to the customer</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>You have a great product; you've thought through, designed and tested every feature.</strong>  But when it comes to customer support, <strong>did you take the <em>same</em> amount of time and attention?</strong> Or did you just slap in a contact form?</p>
      <h3><strong><em>A great customer experience</em> = great product + great support</strong></h3>
      <p>That's the equation that works. <strong>Great product, but poor support?</strong> Your customers will love you until they reach out for help (at which point they will become bitter and resentful). Even worse: a bad experience will have the customer questioning <strong><em>why </em></strong>they pay you money.</p>

      <h3>Offering great customer support costs money</h3>
      <p>It costs money to plan and design a good support interface. It costs money to set-up high quality communications channels (phone, email, support documentation).  <strong>And, most of all, it costs money to get (and retain) great people that can deliver a high level of support.</strong> The <a href="http://bit.ly/jjrefmi">software company</a> I work for always tries to hire the best, <strong><em>especially when it comes to the staff who will be interacting every day, every hour with our customers.</em></strong> If a <em>bad</em> support interaction has the potential to turn a paying customer into a non-paying "former" customer, then we need to invest in creating <em>great </em>support interactions.</p>
      <h3>How to design a customer support process</h3>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Create a plan for each support channel: </strong>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Phone: </strong>Where will the customer find your phone number? Do you want someone to answer right away, or to have a touchtone menu? What will your hold music sound like? Do you want phones to ring (at the same time) in your eastern <em>and </em>western offices?</li>
      <li><strong>Email, Live Chat: </strong>Where will the customer find your email? Will you use Gmail to process email requests, or support software like <a href="http://charmhq.com/">Charm</a>, <a href="http://www.assistly.com/">Assistly</a> or Zendesk? How will you customize the macros? Will you use automatic "robo-replies" when a customer emails you?</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation and Support Forums: </strong>Will you have online documentation? Who will write it? How will it be organized?</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback mechanisms: </strong>How will you know if you're doing a good job? Will you use surveys, <a href="http://smiley.37signals.com/">agent rating tools</a>, or random user testing?</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Design your support site: </strong>based on your plan for each channel, now it's time to start designing the support webpages, and the interfaces the customers will be using when contacting support. <strong>The key with support UI is to make it easy: </strong>reduce the number of clicks, and the amount of time, a user needs to take before getting an answer.</li>
      <li><strong>Build your system: </strong>now it's time to build what you've designed. Manage the project the same way you build software. You need to think of the whole process in the same way as <strong>building your next killer feature</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Launch</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Test it: </strong>This stage is important. Just like any other feature, you need to test your customer support system. Use <a href="http://usertesting.com">UserTesting.com</a> and have anonymous testers try to contact support, and rate their experience. Upload a screenshot of your homepage to the <a href="http://theclicktest.com/">ClickTest</a>, and ask testers to click where they would look first for support. Have customers rate their support experience, similar to <a href="http://smiley.37signals.com/">37signals' Smiley program</a>. Send a follow-up email to a customer and ask them what you could do better.</li>
      <li><strong>Refine: </strong>Based on your testing, it's time to refine the system. Go back and redesign the parts that aren't working well.</li>
      </ol>
