    text: '<p>Having a group where you can express how you''re feeling (whether it''s just an emoji reaction, or commenting in the thread) is incredibly cathartic.&nbsp;</p><p>It''s helpful to share our struggles, and to know when other people are struggling. This is especially true for founders and entrepreneurs, who sometimes don''t feel understood by their friends and family. (That''s why we started <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a>).</p><p>Regular check-ins like this give us the opportunity to reflect on how we''re feeling, and articulate it. Sometimes all you need is the prompt.</p><h2>Write and destroy</h2><p>A few years ago, when I was really depressed, I found this <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/mentalhealth">Dan Harmon</a> quote, and it <b>really </b>helped me:</p><blockquote><p>"Dark thoughts will echo off the walls of your skull; they will distort and magnify. When you open your mouth (or write in an anonymous journal), these thoughts go out. You gotta get ''em out. Vent them. Tap them. Try it."</p></blockquote><p>I was really drawn to the idea of being able to write out my most agonized feelings, and then shred them.</p><p>I built this little site called <a href="https://writeanddestroy.com">writeanddestroy.com</a>&nbsp;that allows you to do just that:&nbsp;</p>'
