      <p><strong>When it comes to venture funded startups, the script is clear: <em>you need to move to Silicon Valley</em>.</strong> This is the epicentre for meeting the "who's who" and raising money for your tech company. Jason Calacanis trumpets this on his podcast:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Yes, location, location, location. If you want to be in the internet business, immediately leave Tulsa. You need to run like a melon farmer to Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, or New York. That's it. That's where the startups are."</p></blockquote>
      <p>- Jason Calacanis, <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/blog/all-ask-jason-twist-297.html">TWiST #297</a></p>
      <p><strong>Here's the problem: </strong>not everyone wants to move to Northern California. There are start-up minded people, like me, who want to stay in our hometowns. Many of us have families, and deep roots where we live; we want to grow profitable businesses, and make <em>our communities</em> better.</p>
      <p><strong>I think our hope is in bootstrapping. </strong>Take a look at these popular bootstrapped companies, and where they were founded:</p>

      <p><em>* no longer bootstrapping (they were profitable prior to taking funding, or being sold)</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/258831616443576320"><strong>You can start a bootstrapped company almost anywhere.</strong></a></p>
      <p>MailChimp is one of the world's largest email service providers. They also happen to be privately owned, and headquartered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. Ryan Carson started Treehouse (originally Think Vitamin) in the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset">Bath, UK</a>. This is a city of only 84,000 people. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin">Club Penguin was sold to Disney for $350 million</a>, but continues to operate out of its founding city: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelowna">Kelowna, BC</a>, a tourism town with a population under 120,000.</p>
      <p>These companies have proven that you don't need to move to Northern California to start a profitable, tech based company. In most cases, the founders just stayed in the town where they were living; places like Cape Town, Philadelphia, or Toronto.</p>
      <p><em>What do you think? Is it possible to start a fulfilling, profitable business no matter where you live?</em></p>
