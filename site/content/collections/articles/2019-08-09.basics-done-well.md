      <blockquote><p>The software industry is obsessed with touting features while the public [has] an entirely different set of criteria: Does it solve my basic problems and is it easy to use? Does it make sense? Do I understand it?</p><p>The real lesson for me is this: <i>People want the basics done well.</i> Does it look good, does it feel good, is it comfortable, is it clear, is it easy? No matter what you’re selling, those seem to be the things that really matter. Get those right and you’ve got a great shot at building a successful product and business.<br>
