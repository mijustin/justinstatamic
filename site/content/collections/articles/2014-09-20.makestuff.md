      <p>I just spent at week in Portland. I was there to visit the new <a href="https://sprint.ly/blog/grand-opening/">Sprintly office</a>, and to take part in the <a href="http://2014.xoxofest.com/">XOXO Conference</a>.</p>
      <p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/chase_reeves">Chase Reeves</a> was kind enough to welcome me into his XOXO posse. We did things together: we went to conference talks, listened to live music, drank great coffee, and shared meals.</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <p>During one meal, somebody asked how many domain names each of us owned. I logged into my <a href="https://hover.com/justinj">Hover account</a> and started counting.</p>
      <p>46.</p>
      <p>I own 46 domains. Of these, about 21 are being actively used. The others? Most of them are domains I purchased in a fit of inspiration. I had a good idea, registered the name and... did nothing.</p>
      <h3>How many domains do you own?</h3>
      <p>If you're like me, you're holding on to these domains with the hope that you'll eventually do something <em>big</em> with them. These domains represent your dreams: a new startup, a profitable product, or a popular project.</p>
      <p>But we're paying for these domains year after year. What if we did something cool with them <em>right now</em>?</p>
      <p>This lead me to this tweet:</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/512962881730928641</p>
      <p>Remember when the web was fun? I keep thinking about <a href="http://bizbox.ca/kidlet/">my daughter building her first web page</a>. Her web page is delightful because she was having fun. She wasn't thinking about being #1 on Product Hunt, or having a $50,000 product launch. She just wanted to tell a story.</p>
      <p>At XOXO, Jonathan Mann talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/therockcookiebottom">creating a song a day</a>. My favorite line from his talk was:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/513418609360904192">"The more stuff you make, the more good stuff you'll make."</a>
      </p></blockquote>
      <p>So many times, I've gotten in a rut because I'm trying to make the "next big thing." This is bad, because when I'm in a rut, I don't create and I've realized that I get enormous joy out of just making things.</p>
      <p>When Samuel Hulick tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelHulick/status/479031449127903232">"I fucking hate timezones</a>", I made <a href="http://ifuckinghatetimezones.com">this site</a> in a few minutes as a joke. <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelHulick/status/479038292810555392">It made his day</a>. Actually, <strong>it made my day</strong>. Just creating and <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/how-to-start/">shipping something small</a> <em>made me feel good</em>.</p>
      <p>Let's quit being so serious. Let's do something with these unused domains. <strong>Let's make some stuff</strong>.</p>
      <p>Are you with me? Here's what I'm thinking; it's an experiment in shipping, having fun, and being creative:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Pick a dormant domain name that you own.</li>
      <li>Forward it to a sub-domain / folder / file on your personal site (for example, thisisawebpage.com forwards to justinjackson.ca/words.html). <em>This is optional, but it will ensure that your project lives on, even if your domain expires.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Create your project</strong>. It could anything: a single HTML page, an online game, a small project for sale, a joke, or a piece of art. If you're looking for inspiration, look at <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html">Jennifer Dewalt's site</a>.</li>
      <li>Send your creations to me. Each week, I'll publish them in this weekly newsletter and on <a href="http://strongmaker.com/">strongmaker.com</a> (one of my unused domains).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That's it. Create a small project for every one of the domain names you’ve bought, but haven’t used. Ship one a week.</p>
      <p>Now let's go have some fun!</p>
