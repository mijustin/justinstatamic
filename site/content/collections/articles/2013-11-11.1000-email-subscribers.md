      <p>I was thinking last night, and I realized that the best thing I've done in the last 5 months was building an email list. It's not easy building a list, especially from scratch. I asked this question on Twitter:</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/399764566650785792</p>
      <p>Many people responded (<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/399912926855057408">I posted that same question this morning</a> and had more great responses).</p>
      <h3>Do you want to build your email list from 0 to 1,000? Let's start with the first 100.</h3>
      <p>This week, I'm going to teach you how to build your list. Maybe you're building a list for the first time, or, you have a new project and you want to build a really high quality, focused list.</p>
