      <p>Your marketing approach will depend on the pain you're targeting.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"One thing that people don't appreciate enough is that there's different types of pain." - <a href="http://productpeople.tv/2012/12/26/patio11-part2/">Patrick McKenzie</a></p></blockquote>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <p>Before you start building your product, ask yourself: how intense is the pain I am targeting? This is important, because the level of pain a customer is experiencing will determine:</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_0">
      <li>How much they are willing to pay for the solution</li>
      <li>How desperate they are to find a solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To explain, I'm going to ask you to think about your dentist (stay with me).</p>
      <p>Your dentist deals with different thresholds of pain:</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_1">
      <li><strong>Extreme pain</strong>: "ARGH! This toothache is killing me! I need a dentist right now!!!"</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate pain</strong>: "My gums have been bugging me lately. I should book an appointment sometime soon."</li>
      <li><strong>Low pain</strong>: "I haven't gone in for a checkup yet this year."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(I also like the way <a href="https://twitter.com/mbuckbee">Michael Buckbee</a> categorizes pain intensity. He asks: "Does this pain need morphine, aspirin, or a vitamin?")</p>
      <p>Notice how the type of marketing your dentist employs corresponds with the intensity of the pain:</p>
      <h3 id="extreme-pain-(morphine)">Extreme pain (morphine)</h3>
      <p>The customer is highly motivated to find a solution. They google "dentists nearby" and book an appointment with the first office that has availability.</p>
      <p>In a situation like this, search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) would be the primary focus. This is "pull marketing": the customer is desperate and in motion. They're under pressure to find a solution quickly, which is why having good page rank (or an ad at the top of the screen) makes sense.</p>
      <p>Businesses targeting <em>extreme pain</em> also have a pricing advantage. Often, the greater the pain, the more people are willing to pay (this is why Uber is able to use <a href="https://support.uber.com/hc/en-us/articles/201836656-What-is-surge-pricing-and-how-does-it-work-">surge pricing</a>).</p>
      <p>What are some examples of products that solve <em>extreme pain</em> points?</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_2">
      <li><a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>: "If we don't figure out this integration this week, we're going to lose this deal."</li>
      <li><a href="https://json-csv.com/">JSON-CSV</a>: "My developer went home for the day, and I need to convert this JSON data to a CSV right now."</li>
      <li><a href="http://churnbuster.io">Churnbuster</a>: "How am I going to deal with all the customers with expiring credit cards?"</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="moderate-pain-(aspirin)">Moderate pain (aspirin)</h3>
      <p>Marketing moderate pain points employs both "push" and "pull" techniques.</p>
      <p>For example, the dentist might place an ad in the paper that says:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Experiencing gum discomfort? We can fix that"</p></blockquote>
      <p>This is push marketing: it proactively reminds the customer that there is a solution for their problem.</p>
      <p>But some customers might be personally motivated to google "how to get rid of gum pain", so the dentist could also write a series of blog posts on different treatment options (pull marketing).</p>
      <p><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20238?token=tAfRV6722DrS3sM_b0XSt72HLzl_NLGDJy-_5pzn3ItsPsR9Rh9M97rBruBR1P0IgM1kLil1HV8re7JIXIN28NI" alt="how-to-get-rid-of-gum-pain.png" /></p>
      <p>There is a lot of opportunity to solve moderate pain points, but it's also where many entrepreneurs fail. Finding a pain that people will pay to get rid of isn't easy.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"You want people who know they have the problem and who are actively looking for solutions, rather than a pain that's bearable." - <a href="http://productpeople.tv/2012/12/26/patio11-part2/">Patrick McKenzie</a></p></blockquote>
      <p>What are some use-cases where products solve <em>moderate pain</em> points?</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_3">
      <li><a href="https://baremetrics.io/">Baremetrics</a>: "I really wish I didn't have to update this Excel sheet manually with our SaaS numbers every month."</li>
      <li><a href="http://sprint.ly/?utm_source=justinblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=justinjackson">Sprintly</a>: "I wish I didn't have to interrupt my developers every time I needed a status update on this project."</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="low-pain-(vitamin)">Low pain (vitamin)</h3>
      <p>What do I mean by "low pain"? These are problems that require more of a vitamin, than an aspirin.</p>
      <p>These solutions require <strong>a lot</strong> of push marketing. The company needs to both show the consumer that they have a <em>problem</em>, and then convince them to purchase their <em>solution</em>.</p>
      <p>Your dentist's office spends a considerable amount of its budget reminding you to come in for regular checkups. They'll send you a postcard every 6 months, and follow-up with phone calls, just to get you to book that appointment.</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1062" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amount-of-push-marketing-required-1024x726.png" alt="Amount of push marketing required" width="600" height="425" /></p>
      <p>Most people don't wake up in the morning and think: "I should call my dentist today". Getting you to book that appointment requires an outside <em>push</em>.</p>
      <p>Here are some examples of web products that solve <em>low pain</em> points:</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_4">
      <li><a href="http://www.stamps.com/">Stamps.com</a>: "Going to the post office is annoying."</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>: "My brother-in-law keeps bugging me to build him a website."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you listen to podcasts, you know that Stamps.com and Squarespace spend a considerable amount of money trying to convince you to visit their websites. This is push marketing at play. If you're selling a vitamin, you're likely going to need a lot of marketing dollars to make sales.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>I have a theory: there's an inverse relationship between the level of pain and the <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/play-the-long-game/">number of exposures</a> a customer needs before he buys.</p>
      <p>As an example, the distribution could look something like this:</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_5">
      <li>Extreme pain: 1-2 exposures</li>
      <li>Moderate pain: 3-7 exposures</li>
      <li>Low pain: 8-100+ exposures (much harder to forecast)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In advertising, they call this <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_frequency">effective frequency</a></em>. There's a number of models and theories around optimal frequency (some say 3, others say 7 is the magic number).</p>
      <p>However, there is some evidence that supports my theory:</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_6">
      <li>Indochino (low pain) <a href="http://www.getelastic.com/retargeting-case-study-should-you-use-frequency-capping/">bumped up it's retargeting frequency</a> from 3 impressions per user per day, to 15-20. "Every time we’ve increased it, we’ve seen greater revenue and ROI".</li>
      <li>When <a href="https://retargeter.com/blog/more/case-studies/b2b-retargeting-vs-b2c-retargeting">ReTargeter did a study</a> on conversions per impression, they found that B2B (high pain) ads outperformed B2C (low pain) ads by 402%. "There tends to be a higher sense of purchase urgency with business solutions than with consumer goods."</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p>It's not enough to find a pain point and build a solution. You have to remember that different types of pain will require different marketing approaches.</p>
      <p>If you're marketing an <strong>extreme pain</strong> solution, focus on SEO and SEM.</p>
      <p><strong>Moderate pain</strong> products generally require a full-spectrum of tactics. You'll use push marketing (ads, retargeting, content marketing, PR), as well as pull marketing (SEO, email courses).</p>
      <p>If you're planning on building a <strong>low pain</strong> product, remember that you'll likely need a big marketing budget. The only low-cost acquisition strategy here is "viral", and it's extremely difficult to get right. Historically, there have been opportunities in SEO to secure low competition, high traffic keywords; but those are increasingly hard to find.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"I’ve got a product that’s In the low pain category and you nailed the drawbacks." - <a href="https://twitter.com/dennis_field/status/505568192765644800">Dennis Field</a></p></blockquote>
      <p><strong>A few notes</strong>:</p>
      <ul id="draft_check_box_list_7">
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/jjhageman/status/505554126290173952">Jeremy Hageman</a> makes a good point about pain frequency: some pains reoccur daily (<a href="https://www.waze.com/">commuter traffic</a>), while others may only be experienced once a year (<a href="http://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-software/index.jsp">income taxes</a>).</li>
      <li>Pain points move up and down the continuum: what requires morphine today, might only require an aspirin tomorrow. There are all sorts of factors that can affect this: improving technology, increased competition, the changing behaviors and values of customers.</li>
      <li>Most successful B2B products have both "extreme pain" and "moderate pain" use cases, and market to both.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I hope this was helpful!</p>
