The topic of gifts came up. "Where do you guys shop for your girlfriends/wives?" someone asked. Multiple people mentioned <a href="https://www.wildflowergeneral.com/">&nbsp;Wildflower General Store&nbsp;</a> here in Vernon. If I was the owner of that store, I''d be optimizing search results for "gift ideas for women vernon bc".</p><p>While some purchases are impulse-driven (like seeing something cool on Instagram and buying right away), most sales come from intent-based searches.</p><p>People already know they want to buy something, and they go out looking for it.</p>'

Or find new ones to ‚Äúbuild for?‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>For existing products (like <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">&nbsp;Transistor&nbsp;</a>), I send an automated email asking customers how they found us. If they respond, I ask for specifics: "Do you remember what you typed into google when you were looking?"</p><p>For new product ideas, I observe what people ask for recommendations for on Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord, as well as in real-world locations (like coffee shops, conferences, and barbershops).</p>'
