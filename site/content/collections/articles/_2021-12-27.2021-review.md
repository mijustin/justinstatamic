    text: '<p>When I sit down to do these year-in-review posts, the hardest part is figuring out how open I can be. I think vulnerability has been a crucial ingredient in my best writing; but it feels like there''s a limit on how many layers deep I can go in public.</p><p>Here, I''ll do my best to share my experience of 2021, but keep in mind that it''s all fairly close to the surface. It''s a representation of my year, but a fairly flat one.</p>'

    text: '<p>Starting in January, I found myself playing piano and guitar a lot more frequently. I''m not incredibly good at either, but I found something meditative about plunking on piano keys, or strumming the same three chords on guitar. It''s a practice I''ve continued until now: strum, strum, plink, plunk, breathe, empty my mind.</p><p>The <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/07/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf">attack on the Capitol</a> in the USA made me angry and sad.</p><p>Judging from my <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1355523396876963841">tweets</a>, and accidental screenshots on my phone, I spent a fair amount of time exploring <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> at the beginning of the year. By the end of the year, most of the excitement surrounding Clubhouse had waned.</p><p>We really had the most glorious spring in 2021. Everything felt alive, lush, fresh, colorful.</p>'

I got my first dose (AstraZeneca) in May.</p><p>We still weren''t able to travel widely, but spring in Vernon was warm, and we got outside a ton. Everything felt picturesque.</p>'

The first was a trip to Canmore and Banff where we met up with my sister, her husband, my three nieces, and my baby nephew that I''d never met. After being away from each other for the whole pandemic it was life-giving to be together again.</p>'

    text: '<p>This was followed by trip to a family resort, where we swam in the pool, zip-lined, and went waterskiing.</p><p>But just as we were easing into summer vacation, the fires in BC came. For most of July and August we lived under a fiery red sky, filled toxic smoke and ash. It was truly awful. We couldn''t go outside, and the air quality was some of the worst in the world (AQI hit 500+ on many days).</p>'
