    text: '<p>When I sit down to do these year-in-review posts, the hardest part is figuring out how open I can be. I think vulnerability has been a crucial ingredient in my best writing; but it feels like there''s a limit on how many layers deep I can go in public.</p><p>Here, I''ll do my best to share my experience of 2021, but keep in mind that it''s all fairly close to the surface. It''s a representation of my year, but a fairly flat one.</p>'

    text: '<p><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/4e2424aa">At the beginning of the year</a>, I think my co-founder (Jon) and I were both feeling weary from the pandemic and American politics. As a two person company, we decided to be gentle with ourselves, and our immediate ambitions for the company. Despite all that, we ended up shipping some significant features <a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/private-podcast-email/">for private podcasting</a> in the first quarter.</p><p>We did end up making two big moves in 2021: in April we hired <a href="https://transistor.fm/helen/">Helen full-time</a> (as Head of Customer Success), and in August <a href="https://transistor.fm/jason/">we hired Jason</a>&nbsp;(a full-time Senior Rails Developer). Jon and I both agree: these hires were the best part of the year. Transistor is now a team of four people!</p>'

    text: '<p>The biggest feature we released in 2021 was <a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/midroll/">Dynamic Audio Insertion</a>. This allows podcasters to automatically insert insert an audio ad, or announcement, at the beginning, middle,&nbsp;or end of every episode in your feed. Some of our competitors (like Spotify''s <a href="https://megaphone.fm/">Megaphone</a>) charge a lot of money for these features, so we''re excited to make it accessible to our customers at a lower price-point.</p><h2>What happened in 2021 (personal)</h2><p>The first quarter of 2021 felt like a continuation of 2020. We were still living in our bubble due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>I continue to be incredibly thankful for our local mountain, <a href="https://www.skisilverstar.com/">Silverstar</a>. We spent much of January, February, and March skiing and snowboarding there. The mountains are good for the soul; especially during a pandemic.</p><p>In January, my wife finished a big pandemic project: a redesign of the <a href="https://coworkvernon.com/">coworking office</a> that I run with a few locals. Her and her friend did an incredible job.</p>'

    text: '<p>Starting in January, I started playing piano and guitar a lot more frequently. I''m not incredibly good at either, but I found something meditative about plunking on piano keys, or strumming the same three chords on guitar. It''s a practice I''ve continued until now: strum, strum, plink, plunk, breathe, empty my mind.</p><p>The <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/07/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf">attack on the Capitol</a> in the USA made me angry and sad.</p><p>Judging from my <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1355523396876963841">tweets</a>, and accidental screenshots on my phone, I spent a fair amount of time exploring <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> at the beginning of the year. By the end of the year, most of the excitement surrounding Clubhouse had waned.</p><p>We really had the most glorious spring in 2021. Everything felt alive, lush, fresh, colorful.</p>'

For most of July and August we lived under a fiery red sky, filled toxic smoke and ash. It was truly awful. We couldn''t go outside, and the air quality was some of the worst in the world (AQI hit 500+ on many days).</p>'
