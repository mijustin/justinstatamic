      <p>As product people, we don't want to create something that's just <em data-redactor-tag="em">good</em>. We want it to <em data-redactor-tag="em">resonate</em> with people.</p>
      <p>When I launch something new, my biggest fear is that people <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">won't like it, won't care, or won't show up.</strong></p>
      <p>Additionally, a lot of people I know also struggle to <em>promote </em>the things they've made.</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1284" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/comic-creative-fear.png" alt="My biggest creative fear" width="1336" height="600" /></p>
      <p>These two pain points are related. If you're not confident that people will like what you've made, it's hard to promote it.</p>
      <p><em data-redactor-tag="em">No one wants to send out party invitations, and have zero people show up on a Friday night.</em></p>
      <h3>How can you get over this fear?</h3>
      <p>You don't.</p>
      <p>You never <em data-redactor-tag="em">truly </em>get over the fear of launching something no one wants.</p>
      <p>But you can <em data-redactor-tag="em">reduce</em> it. There's a feedback loop you can go through that will give you the confidence you need. It's a system for discovering products people <em data-redactor-tag="em">want</em><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">.</span></p>
      <p>It looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Research your audience. Embed yourself in their community. Hang out every day. Listen.</li>
      <li>Observe the topics, pain points, and desires that come up over and over again. Make a list.</li>
      <li>Prioritize the list. Which topics do you think are most important to this group?</li>
      <li>Create something <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">small</strong> that solves your audience's #1 issue.</li>
      <li>Launch it. Observe the reaction. Gather feedback.</li>
      <li>Iterate by making something a bit <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">bigger</strong>. Try charging a bit of money for it. How do people respond? How hard is it to find customers?</li>
      <li>Keep repeating this cycle until you're sure you've found a <strong>problem </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">that people <em data-redactor-tag="em">really </em>care about and a <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">solution</strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"> that they'll pay for.</span></span></span></span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>I realize that this might seem simplistic. But when you show up every day, you'll find opportunities to help people in meaningful ways.</p>
      <p>For example, my friend Jarrod is a designer and hangs out with other designers. His friends were having a hard time communicating their value to clients. So Jarrod decided to write <a href="https://thetinydesigner.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=justinjackson">The Tiny Designer</a>.</p>
      <h3>Learning to promote your projects</h3>
      <p><em data-redactor-tag="em">"Self-promotion just feels so icky. I hate doing it. It's my biggest challenge."</em></p>
      <p>Once you've created a solution that people need, you won't feel like a huckster. You’re helping folks solve their problems (and that's worth doing).</p>
      <p>Now you can focus on your <em>communication technique</em>.</p>
      <p>And technique matters. Making something people <em data-redactor-tag="em">want</em><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"> is no good if they never hear about it.</span></p>

      <p>A lot of marketing is experimentation. It’s knowing about the different approaches, tactics and channels to try. And it’s about having a system for implementing and evaluating your experiments.</p>
      <h3>The starting point</h3>
      <p>To find out what works for you, you need a list of things to test. From the beginning, you’ll want a framework for collecting and evaluating marketing data.This strategy should fit the stage you’re at right now (pre-launch, launching, post-launch).</p>
      <p>These are the topics I cover in <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>. It's for product people, like you.</p>
