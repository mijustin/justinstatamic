We want it to <em>resonate</em> with people.</p><p>When I launch something new, my biggest fear is that people <strong>won''t like it, won''t care, or won''t show up.</strong></p><p>Additionally, a lot of people I know also&nbsp;struggle to <em>promote </em>the things they''ve made.</p>'

    text: '<p>These two pain points are related. If you''re not confident that people will like what you''ve made, it''s hard to promote it.</p><p><em>No one wants to send out party invitations, and have zero people show up on a Friday night.</em></p><h3>How can you get over this fear?</h3><p>You don''t.</p><p>You never <em>truly </em>get over the fear of launching something no one wants.</p><p>But you can <em>reduce</em> it. There''s a feedback loop you can go through that will give you the confidence you need. It''s a system for discovering&nbsp;products&nbsp;people&nbsp;<em>want</em>.</p><p>It looks like this:</p><ol><li>Research your audience. Embed yourself in their community. Hang out every day. Listen.</li><li>Observe the topics, pain points, and desires that come up over and over again. Make a list.</li><li>Prioritize the list. Which topics do you think are most important to this group?</li><li>Create something <strong>small</strong> that solves your audience''s #1 issue.</li><li>Launch it. Observe the reaction. Gather feedback.</li><li>Iterate by making something a bit <strong>bigger</strong>. Try charging a bit of money for it. How do people respond? How hard is it to find customers?</li><li>Keep repeating this cycle until you''re sure you''ve found a <strong>problem </strong>that people <em>really </em>care about and a <strong>solution</strong> that they''ll pay for.</li></ol><p>I realize that this might seem simplistic. But when you&nbsp;show&nbsp;up every day, you''ll find&nbsp;opportunities to help people in meaningful ways.</p><p>For example, my friend Jarrod is a designer and hangs out with other designers. His friends were having a hard time communicating their value to clients. So&nbsp;Jarrod decided to write <a href="https://thetinydesigner.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=justinjackson">The Tiny Designer</a>.</p><h3>Learning to promote your projects</h3><p><em>"Self-promotion just feels so icky. I hate doing it. It''s my biggest challenge."</em></p><p>Once you''ve created a solution that people need, you won''t&nbsp;feel like a huckster. You’re helping folks solve their problems&nbsp;(and that''s worth doing).</p><p>Now you can focus on your&nbsp;<em>communication technique</em>.</p><p>And technique matters. Making something people <em>want</em> is no good if they never hear about it.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/528907890346962944"><br></a></p><p>A lot of marketing is experimentation. It’s knowing about the different approaches, tactics and channels to try. And it’s about having a system for implementing and evaluating your experiments.</p><h3>The starting point</h3><p>To find out what works for you, you need a list of things to test. From the beginning, you’ll want a framework for collecting and evaluating marketing data.This strategy should fit&nbsp;the stage you’re at right now (pre-launch, launching, post-launch).</p><p>These are the topics I cover in <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a>. It''s for product people, like you.</p>'
