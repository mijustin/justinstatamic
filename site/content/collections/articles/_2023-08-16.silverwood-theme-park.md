    text: '<p>People who know me know that I love theme parks and waterparks. My two teenage boys and I just made the 6-hour drive to Northern Idaho to visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.silverwoodthemepark.com/">Silverwood</a>&nbsp;- the largest theme park in the American Northwest.</p><p>This was our second time at Silverwood (the last time in 2019), and I kept thinking of tips and advice I''d want to give myself on our next trip. So, I''m writing it here in case someone else finds it useful.</p><h2>What''s so special about Silverwood Theme Park?</h2><p>Silverwood is unlike any other theme park or water park I''ve visited. First, it''s fairly remote. The nearest city is Coeur dâ€™Alene (population: 55,000), a 30-minute drive away. Spokane, Washington, is a 1-hour drive.</p><p>However, if you''re in Seattle and like road trips, Silverwood is a 5-hour drive. I live in Vernon, BC, and it took us about 6 hours to drive south and reach the theme park.</p><p><br></p><p>But there''s something special about Silverwood that draws over 800,000 people a year to the park. It has a quality and attention to detail that makes it unique. In 1986, the founder, Gary Norton,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.silverwoodexpress.com/2018/04/04/a-step-back-into-yesteryear/">famously outbid</a>&nbsp;the Walt Disney Company on a 1915 steam train. Two years later, he started Silverwood with the train and built the theme park around it. Despite outshining Disney at the train auction, Norton exemplifies many of Disney''s principles: the park is clean, family-friendly, and every corner seems crafted with passion and care.</p>'
