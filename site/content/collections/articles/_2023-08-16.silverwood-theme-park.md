    text: '<p>People who know me know that I love theme parks and waterparks. My two teenage boys and I just made the 6-hour drive to Northern Idaho to visit <a href="https://www.silverwoodthemepark.com/">Silverwood</a> - the largest theme park in the American Northwest.</p><p>This was our second time at Silverwood (the last time in 2019), and I kept thinking of tips and advice I''d want to give myself on our next trip. So, I''m writing it down here just in case someone else might find it useful.</p><p><br></p>'
