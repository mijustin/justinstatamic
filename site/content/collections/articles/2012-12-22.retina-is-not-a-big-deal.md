      <p>Retina is not a big deal.</p>
      <p>I can remember being a kid and switching from CGA to EGA:</p>
      <p><img class="size-full wp-image-688" title="cga-to-ega" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cga-to-ega.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="200" /></p>
      <p>What a difference! We went from purple a turquoise to 16 colors. The next big jump was going from EGA to VGA:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-691" title="ega-to-vga" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ega-to-vga1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="200" /></p>
      <p>I begged my parents to sell our Tandy 1000 so we could buy a new 386 with a VGA monitor. VGA could display 256 colors (at 320 x 200). <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~ervind/kq5screens.html">ATMachine has a great comparison</a> between King's Quest V in EGA and VGA.</p>
      <p><strong>However, the biggest leap was going from VGA</strong> (320 x 200, 256 colors)<strong> to SVGA</strong> (800 x 600, and up to 16 million colors):</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-690" title="vga-to-svga" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/vga-to-svga.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="200" /></p>
      <p>I've used two games from my childhood to illustrate the difference: Scorched Earth (on the left, VGA) and Worms (on the right, SVGA).</p>
      <p><strong>To me, all these jumps: CGA to EGA, EGA to VGA, VGA to SVGA felt significant. </strong></p>
      <p>I'm not sure if I'm just getting old, but the jump from "regular" iPhone, iPad, and Macbook resolutions to Retina doesn't feel as significant:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-693" title="retina" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/retina1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="200" /></p>
      <p>So I'm trying to decide if Retina is a big deal. Eventually, yes, I'll upgrade. But I don't have the same desire to upgrade as I did when I had an EGA video card, and I really wanted a VGA card. Likewise, I wonder if my kids would notice (or care) about the difference between a Retina and non-Retina display.</p>
