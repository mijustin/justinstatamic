    text: '<p>There''s an old internet myth that goes like this:</p><ul><li>The web is big and has billions of users.</li><li>Because the web is so big, even small niches have thousands of members.</li><li>Therefore, you can target almost any niche and make money on the internet.</li></ul><p>It''s probably best exemplified in this old Merlin Mann quote from SXSW in 2009:</p><blockquote><p>"Don’t have a blog about Star Wars, have a blog about Jawas. In fact, have a blog about that one Jawa who is only the scene for a minute. It’s going to be so much easier for you to dominate."</p></blockquote><p>In his book,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/746122">Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</a>, Al Ries agrees. He says that as markets get more crowded, you''ll need to figure out ways to stand out somehow:</p><blockquote><p>"In the communication jungle out there, the only hope to score big is to be selective, to concentrate on narrow targets, to practice segmentation. In a word, ''positioning.''"</p></blockquote><p>There is some wisdom in this. If you don''t have a specific target in mind, it''s difficult to build a unique position in the market.</p><p>But this "niche market theory" has limitations (and risks) that haven''t been talked about much.</p><h2>1,000 true fans?</h2><p>In 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote a <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">groundbreaking essay</a> that made a bold promise:</p><blockquote><p>To be a successful creator you don’t need millions. You need only thousands of true fans.</p></blockquote><p>Kelly''s theory was full of optimism. He spearheaded the idea that the internet makes almost any niche viable:</p>'

    text: '"As far as I can tell there is nothing — no product, no idea, no desire — without a fan base on the internet. Every thing made can interest at least one person in a million. Yet if even only one out of million people were interested, that’s potentially 7,000 people on the planet. That means that any 1-in-a-million appeal can find 1,000 true fans."'

    text: '<p>His math works out in the sense that 1,000 people x $100 year = $100,000 (which for most people is a pretty good salary).</p><p>But in practice, the math is more complicated. It''s complicated by something he alludes to later:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"The trick is to practically find those fans, or more accurately, to have them find you."</p></blockquote><p>Finding, pitching, and convincing folks to buy your product is harder than it seems!</p><p>In 1961, two researchers (Lavidge and Steiner) came up with a model for describing product awareness:</p><ul><li><b>Stage 1: Awareness </b>– a potential customer becomes aware of your product.</li><li><b>Stage 2: Knowledge</b> – they then learn more about what you offer, or see other people using your product.</li><li><b>Stage 3: Liking</b> – after gaining some knowledge, the potential customer decides if they like what you offer.</li><li><b>Stage 4: Preference</b> – next, the potential customer will decide if they prefer your product, compared to other options on the market.</li><li><b>Stage 5: Conviction</b> – the customer investigates your product further, and starts to lean towards a purchase.</li><li><b>Stage 6: Purchase</b> – the customer buys your product (and hopefully tells their friends about it!).</li></ul><p>What Kelly describes in his essay only accounts for Stages 1 &amp; 2. But to earn revenue from a fan, you''ll need to get these folks to like what you offer. Plus:&nbsp;these prospects will need to have the ability and conviction to pay you.</p><p>With that in mind, it''s clear: it''s not tenable to start with 7,000 potential fans and have enough people go through all six stages.</p><p>You''re going to need a bigger pool of prospects.</p><h2>How big of a market do you need to bootstrap a successful software business?</h2><p>I''ve observed hundreds of independent entrepreneurs, at MicroConf, in MegaMaker, and in my role as an advisor.</p><p>There are exceptions but almost everyone who is consistently earning more than $10k / month (and certainly those who break $50k) targeted a large, or fast-growing, market that they could reach efficiently.</p><p>How large does it need to be? Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>There are over 5 million PHP developers in the world, so when Taylor Otwell launched <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/">Forge</a> he got 1,000 customers within a month.</li><li>There are over 500,000 Shopify stores, so when Björn started making <a href="https://www.forsbergplustwo.com/">Shopify apps</a>, he had a big pool of potential customers. Within 6 years, he was earning $275,000 in annual revenue.</li><li>When Ruben Gamez saw that DocuSign had over 200 million users, he thought: "That''s a big market." And so he launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docsketch.com/">Docsketch</a>.</li></ul><p>Seth Godin thinks we should ask:</p><blockquote><p>"What’s the minimum number of people you would need to influence to make it worth the effort?"</p></blockquote><p>But, I think you still need to look at the broader picture: what is the <b>total</b> addressable market?</p><p>Because we''re likely not going to be able to influence 100%, 50%, or even 25% of a given market.</p><p>Typically, we start our funnels at "number of visitors" but in reality, the funnel looks like this:&nbsp;</p>'

      **Justin:** Did starting the company turn out the way you thought?
      
      **Harry:** I thought it would be a few weeks and we'd be raking in the dough. And it turns out it was more like years... (laughs)
      
      **Justin:** So, how many years were you guys both working on this before you'd made even any sensible money?
      
      **Ted:** I'm not sure what you mean by "sensible." (laughs)
      
      **Justin:** Like, enough to live off. Enough to cover both of your life costs.
      
      **Ted:** Well, it took a while before we were paying ourselves even a reasonable salary. Because for the first year and a half, we paid ourselves nothing. Then at about a year and a half, that's when we actually hired a couple employees. So at that point we started paying ourselves a salary, but it was very minimal.

      **Justin:** So if you could do it again, would you start the same company? 
      
      **Ted:** Probably not. (Laughs) Because it's just been a very long, slow grind. One of the reasons this market is available to us is because it's difficult.
      
      You read about all these other startups we could be doing: something that targets a larger market. There, you can do the same amount of work, but get twice as many customers or ten times as many customers. 
      
      Because our product is complex, and people aren't just searching the web for it, sales is more difficult, the marketing is more difficult, support is more difficult.
