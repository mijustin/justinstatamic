    text: '<p>Currently, <a href="https://transistor.fm">I''m working on this</a>.</p><p>As an independent founder, I''m wearing a lot of hats: product development, marketing, replying to emails, making podcasts, writing, and admin work.</p><p>I get quite a few emails (and Twitter DMs) asking asking me if I can jump on a call with folks. Most of the time I have to say:</p><blockquote><p>Sorry, I can''t. I''m slammed right now.</p></blockquote><p>However, I do have a rule: if you come to Vernon, BC, I''ll buy you a coffee.</p><p>I purposefully live in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, surrounded by lakes and mountains. It''s not easy getting here. So if you make the trip, and I''m around, I''ll happily meet you at <a href="https://www.ratiocoffee.ca/">Ratio Coffee</a> downtown.</p><p>Over the years, I''ve had quite a few people take me up on this offer. One fellow came from Japan. Two French Canadians were driving cross-country in a Westfalia. There was even Paul, from the UK, who rode his bicycle.</p><p>Are you in town? Send me a message. Let''s do coffee.</p>'
