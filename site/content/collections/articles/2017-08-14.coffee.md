      <p>As a solo-founder, I'm super busy. I do almost everything myself: product development, marketing, replying to emails, making podcasts, writing, and admin work.</p>
      <p>If you email me asking me if I can jump on a call (or if you can pick my brain) chances are I'll have to say:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Sorry, I can't. I'm slammed right now.</p></blockquote>
      <p>(Currently, <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">I'm working on this</a>).</p>
      <p>However, I do have one exception: if you come to Vernon, BC, I'll buy you a coffee.</p>
      <p>I purposefully live in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, surrounded by lakes and mountains. It's not easy getting here. So if you make the trip, and I'm around, I'll happily meet you at Ratio Coffee downtown.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've had some people take me up on this offer. One fellow came from Japan. Two French Canadians were driving cross-country in a Westfalia. There was even Paul, from the UK, who rode his bicycle.</p>
      <p>Are you in town? Send me a message. Let's do coffee.</p>
