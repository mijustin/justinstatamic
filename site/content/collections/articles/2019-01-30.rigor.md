    text: '<p>I always liked writing.&nbsp;</p><p>In elementary school, my teachers raved over my prose. This encouragement made me feel good, which lead me to write in my spare time. By the time I entered high school, I felt like I was a "good writer."<br></p><p>Then I joined, Dr. Nyberg''s advanced English class.</p><p>The first day, she gave us our assignment: "write a three-point essay."</p><p>Up until this point, I''d been able to get by on natural talent. English was easy! Often, I would my assignments immediately before class.</p><p>So, when I handed in my essay to Dr. Nyberg, I was expecting an A+. But when I got it back there were no affirmative platitudes. Instead, the margins of my paper were drenched with Nyberg''s marking pen. She pointed out all the places I could improve: succinct sentences, better structure, a stronger introduction.</p><p>It wasn''t just me. She was pushing the whole class beyond our comfort zone.&nbsp;We wrote a new essay almost every single week.&nbsp;And each time I handed a paper in, there would be suggestions on how I could improve my writing.</p><p>This meant her class wasn''t always fun! In fact, I remember us complaining about it: </p><blockquote><p>"Nyberg, you''re making us write another essay?! Can''t we do something else?" </p></blockquote><p>Writing essays over and over again seemed redundant. What was the point?</p><p>It didn''t become clear until I graduated high school and went to college.</p><p>When I arrived, my first assignment was to write an essay in class. Looking around, my classmates appeared pained. They didn''t know where to start. Even the idea of starting with an introduction, and ending with a conclusion, was foreign to them.</p><p>But I could have written that paper in my sleep. To this day, writing comes easier to me than a lot of my peers. And that''s not because of ingrained talent. That ability was hammered into me by Dr. Nyberg.</p><p>Looking back now, I''m thankful that I had those years of rigorous practice in English class.</p><p>There are times I look at the education system, and I think it needs to be reformed.&nbsp;But one feature we shouldn''t remove is the teacher who&nbsp;has the confidence to say:</p><blockquote><p>"I''m an expert, and I''m going to push you beyond your comfort zone."</p></blockquote>'
