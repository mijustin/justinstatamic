    text: '<p>On our first day in class, she gave us an assignment:</p><blockquote><p>"Write a three-point essay."</p></blockquote><p>This seemed easy enough.</p><p>Up until this point, I''d been able to get by on natural talent. I hadn''t had to try that hard to get good marks.</p><p>So, when I handed in my essay to Dr. Nyberg, I was expecting an A+.&nbsp;</p><p>But when I got it back there were no affirmative platitudes. Instead, the margins of my paper were drenched with Nyberg''s marking pen. She pointed out all the places I could improve: succinct sentences, better structure, a stronger introduction.</p><p>And she wasn''t just targeting me. I think the highest class mark on that first paper was a B. For a group of kids who were used to an A+, this was hard to accept. Some kids complained. Dr. Nyberg didn''t bat an eye, she just had us do more writing.</p><p>She was pushing everyone beyond their individual comfort zone.</p><p>We wrote a new essay almost every single week.&nbsp;And each time we handed a paper in, there would be suggestions on how we could improve our writing.</p><p>This meant her class wasn''t always fun. Sometimes, we''d whine:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Nyberg, you''re making us write another essay?! Can''t we do something else?" </p></blockquote><p>Writing essays over and over again seemed redundant. What was the point?</p><p>It didn''t become clear until I graduated high school.</p><h3>I went to college for business</h3><p>In our marketing class, our first assignment was to write an essay.&nbsp;</p><p>I put my head down and intuitively started writing.</p><p>About halfway through, I looked around the class. Nobody else was writing. My classmates were wearing pained expressions. <b>They didn''t know where to start.</b> Even the idea of starting with an introduction, and ending with a conclusion, was foreign to them.</p><p>But, because of the rigorous practice I''d had in Dr. Nyberg''s class, I could have written that paper in my sleep.</p><p>I got an A+.</p><p>To this day day, writing comes easier to me than a lot of my peers. And that''s not because of ingrained talent. It''s a skill that was forged in me through Dr. Nyberg''s coaching.</p><h3>What this means for us</h3><p><br></p>'
