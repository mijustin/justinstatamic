      <p>In 2020, an estimated 104 million Americans listen to a podcast monthly. Last year it grew by 16%. The year before, it grew 23%. And from 2017-2018 it great by 8%.</p><p>These numbers are healthy! But you'll notice,&nbsp;there's no meteoric growth here.</p><p>Personally, I like this gradual growth curve. It's sustainable and shows that podcasting isn't a flash-in-the-pan.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, I strongly believe&nbsp;that steady ecosystems are better for creators. You can build a long-lasting, sustainable revenue stream.
