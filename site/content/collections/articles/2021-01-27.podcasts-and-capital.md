      <p>In 2020, an estimated 104 million Americans listen to a podcast monthly. Last year it grew by 16%. The year before, it grew 23%. And from 2017-2018 it great by 8%.</p><p>These numbers are healthy! But you'll notice,&nbsp;there's no meteoric growth here.</p><p>Personally, I like this gradual growth curve. It's sustainable and shows that podcasting isn't a flash-in-the-pan.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, I strongly believe&nbsp;that steady ecosystems are better for creators. You can build a long-lasting, sustainable revenue stream.
      
      (As long as Big Money™ doesn't mess it up).</p><h2>Is Big Money™ messing it up?</h2><p>Investors are now looking to podcasting to provide them with YouTube-level returns. (For example, Sequoia earned a 57x return on its $9 million investment in YouTube).&nbsp;</p><p>However, I'm highly skeptical that podcasting is ever going to provide that level of returns. As I've shown above, podcasting's adoption curve is different than video, social, or even blogs.</p><p>The amount of money being invested into podcasting is puzzling. In the last 2 years, Spotify has spent $1 billion on podcast acquisitions.</p><p>Keep in mind that in 2021, it's anticipated that podcast ad revenue will be $1 billion (it was $782 million in 2020).</p><p>There's a disconnect here.</p>
