What do you see that could develop into a much larger wave?</li><li><strong>Develop your skillset.</strong> Practice by catching little waves. Paddle every day. Work yourself up to more significant opportunities.</li><li><strong>Develop your network.</strong> Build relationships with other people who catch waves. They might tip you off: "Hey, this wave would be perfect for you."</li><li><strong>If your current market or category isn''t producing good opportunities, move on.</strong> Sitting in a pond waiting for a big wave won''t do you any good!</li><li><strong>Don''t try to turn a small wave into a big wave!</strong> It''s unlikely to get bigger. ðŸ˜‰ Move on.</li><li><strong>Remember, most good waves have competition.</strong> You might get lucky and find an opportunity nobody else has seen. But it''s more likely you''ll be riding the same wave as someone else. How can you compete?</li></ol><p>Most importantly: <strong>forget about your heroes</strong>. They gained their success at a different time. Figure out what works for <em>you</em> at <em>this</em> moment in time.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
