Execution is everything."</i></p><p>I disagree.</p><p><b>If ideas are so easy, why are most business ideas so bad?&nbsp;</b></p><h2>What is a "business idea?"</h2><p>Business ideas are <b>observations</b> paired with <b>hunches</b>.</p><p><b>Observation</b>: <i>"This is what people are doing. This is what people want. This is where the market is headed."</i></p><p><b>Hunch: </b><i>"Here''s a way we could help people to get the result they want (and do it better than what''s currently available)."</i></p><p>The results of your execution hinge on the strength of your original idea. How clear was your initial observation? How correct was your hunch?</p><h2>Why your idea matters</h2><p>The market you choose, and the idea that you focus on, are the most important business decisions you’ll make. They determine your trajectory.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, how you execute is a part of that, but your ceiling for success is set by the idea itself.</p>'

      <p>When an author says: “I have an idea for my next book” the success of that book largely depends on the concept they’ve chosen.
      
      The same is true in business.</p><p>The risk with overemphasizing “execution” is it deludes people into thinking that if they work hard enough they can make any idea successful. It’s just not true.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t believe me, go browse old listings on Product Hunt. 
      
      You’ll see page after page of beautifully executed products that never achieved meaningful traction.
      
      There have been thousands of ideas posted; most failed.&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of tech people who are skilled at building software but struggle to build good software businesses.
      
      The difference is in the quality of their ideas.</p><p>We often compare ideas to seeds. But a bad seed can’t grow into a plant; only a good seed can.&nbsp;
      </p><p>Got a bad idea? Don’t spend lots of time fertilizing it, watering it, and trying to get it to grow. No! Throw it away.
      
      Focus on cultivating good ideas and helping them grow.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to find good business ideas</h2><p>I know talented makers who had to hunt for years before they found a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Identifying a good business opportunity is often the culmination of:</p><ul><li>the experiences you’ve had,</li><li>the markets you’ve observed,</li><li>the customers you’ve listened to,</li><li>the experiments you’ve run.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Good ideas are not easy to find. And often, you have to wait for them to appear.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is, most of us are impatient and want to <i>execute</i> as soon as possible, so we pick the first idea that comes to mind.</p><p>On Twitter, lots of folks told me: "But generating ideas is easy!"</p><p>Yes, coming up with low-quality ideas is easy. But being able to see the shape of a good opportunity is hard. (In the same way that noticing a wave from the beach is easy, but being able to <a href="/surfing">identify a good swell to surf</a> is difficult).</p><blockquote><p>"It's better to create a product for an audience/industry that you're already a part of because you know it well enough to have good hunches about what people need." – <a href="https://twitter.com/coreywstone">Corey Stone</a></p></blockquote><p>Good business ideas come from making&nbsp;<b>observations</b>&nbsp;about how people act in the real world and then having an <b>intuition </b>for the best way to respond.</p><p>This is why copying someone else's ideas rarely works. As <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1561-why-you-shouldnt-copy-us-or-anyone-else">Jason Fried</a> says:</p><blockquote><p>Here’s the problem with copying: Copying skips understanding. Understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why something works or why something is how it is. When you copy it, you miss that.</p></blockquote><p>If you're not generating very many ideas it's probably because:</p><ul><li>you haven't had enough experience in a given sector,</li><li>you haven't learned to observe the way people behave,</li><li>you haven't <a href="/surfing">honed your instincts</a> for recognizing the "pull" of a market.</li></ul><h2>Putting our ideas into action</h2><p>For many people, validating an idea is a part of the "execution" step. They'll build an MVP, put it out into the market, and measure the response. If the response is bad, they'll try to iterate on the original idea (or pivot).</p><p>Execution means "to put a concept into action."&nbsp;</p><h2>Work on ideas that matter</h2><p>Don't rush it.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>
