    text: '<p>Margin, or breathing room, is important in other areas of life as well. Especially business.</p><p>Good businesses have margin.&nbsp;</p><p>Profit margin? Yes.</p><p>But also margin for your time, your emotional and physical health, your relationships, your sanity, and your integrity.</p><h2>A story from my life</h2><p>In my early 20s, I opened a skateboard/snowboard shop with my friend. We named it the Real Deal. It was something I''d dreamed about doing since I was a teenager. I was passionate about snowboarding, and I''d worked on the manufacturing side already. I was looking forward to earning a profit from doing something I loved.</p>'

      <p>But, it was a "low margin" business in every way:</p><ul><li>Low markup on the products we sold (buy a skateboard deck for $32, up to sell it for $50).</li><li>High complexity (ordering, employees, inventory, sales tax, cash flow)</li><li>High risk (you risk your money ordering something you hope a teenager will think is cool)</li><li>High stress (theft, capital)</li><li>Long hours, low pay for owners.</li></ul><p>We never really acknowledged how little breathing room we had in the business; we were in too deep! We just kept “adding more” hoping it would increase our margins.
      
      We added a mini-ramp, did events, published a magazine, ran contests, joined a retail collective, and started doing bike repairs.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back on it now, I can see we were in a dangerous cycle.</p><p>It's something the podcast <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/cautionary-tales/">99% Invisible</a> explored here:</p><blockquote><p>Adding more and more layers to a system intended to avert disaster often makes catastrophe all the more likely.</p></blockquote><p>Were essentially "throwing good effort after bad fundamentals.” The core economics of our business were lousy; adding more complexity to our business didn't fix that.</p><p>And here's the thing about low-margin work: it eventually leads to ruin. The margins rarely get better, but the sunk costs get worse. Every month you dedicate to the bad business reinforces your desire to "make it work."</p><p>We eventually pulled the plug on the Real Deal and closed it two years later.</p><p><br></p>
