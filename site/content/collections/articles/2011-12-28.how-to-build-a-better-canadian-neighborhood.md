      <p><em>Note: this is an update on a blog post I originally wrote on <a href="http://www.strongmaker.com/a-better-canadian-neighborhood/">Strongmaker</a>.</em></p>
      <p>Overall, the new neighbourhoods being built in Canada are poorly designed.  There are two factors at play:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>We have lots of land, and so space is often abused</li>
      <li>Most of our urban design comes from warmer climates</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Here are ways to build a better Canadian neighbourhood:<!--more--></p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>An outdoor skating rink in every neighbourhood: </strong>we need to embrace our winter culture, and get out of our homes to enjoy the outdoors. A skating rink is a great way to do that. City planning departments should mandate that every new neighbourhood constructed has an outdoor skating rink built in.</li>
      <li><strong>Coloured homes: </strong>Canada is white and grey for most of the year.  Why then, do we choose light pastels, greys and off-whites for the exterior of our houses?  We need to take the lead from <a href="http://www.freefoto.com/images/1601/03/1601_03_5---The-Waterfront--Bergen--Norway_web.jpg">countries like Norway</a>, and <a href="http://www.corbisimages.com/images/42-18625973.jpg?size=67&amp;uid=789309EE-F737-4B6C-924B-29AD02E1B491">build coloured homes</a> to help us shake off the winter blues.</li>
      <li><strong>Walkability: </strong>like much of North America, neighbourhoods in Canada have abused the amount of space available to them.  We’ve built <a href="http://butikofer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/suburbs.jpg">sprawling suburbs</a>, where you need to drive to get anywhere.  <strong>Every neighbourhood should have a corner store that’s accessible by foot</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Winterized playgrounds: </strong>traditional playground equipment just doesn’t cut it up north: surfaces are often slippery, and are difficult to navigate when bundled up.  Furthermore, every community should have <a href="http://www.townofbethlehem.org/images/parks/2007Winter/top%20of%20sledding%20hill%202.jpg">a sledding hill</a> within walking distance.</li>
      <li><strong>Mini indoor recreation centers: </strong>the current trend is to build huge rec-centers on the outskirts of a city or town, forcing folks to drive there.  Why can’t we reduce the scope of these facilities and make them more accessible by making more of them?  A simple indoor playground for moms and smaller children, and some exercise equipment is all most families need.</li>
      <li><strong>Warm bus shelters: </strong>bus shelters must be designed in California.  They consist of glass walls, and tin roofs, <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/bus-stop-people-waiting-on-snowy-day.jpg">making them useless in the cold</a>.  Let’s <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3199419758_87715b8597.jpg">add some heaters</a> or insulate these structures and <a href="http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAJ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.actiontransport.ca%2Fissuepapers%2FIP4.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=how+many+canadians+take+public+transit&amp;ei=N03jStLQEYnyMbyVuLsB&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUG01SRXBKQy_ejc-hXrIpzBhxgA&amp;sig2=8abDVGTFyRK4apWigFOD4Q">encourage more Canadians to take transit</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The idea here is to reduce the need for driving, make things more accessible to people by moving amenities closer to home, and to take into consideration our long winters.</p>
