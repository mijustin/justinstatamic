      <p>A lot of bootstrappers tell me they have a marketing problem:</p><blockquote><p>"I need to get better at marketing."</p></blockquote><p>But, 99% of the time, when we dig into it, their problem isn't marketing at all.</p><p>Their problem is usually in their groundwork.</p><p>I like the <a href="http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/groundwork">1913 definition</a> of "groundwork" in the Webster's dictionary:</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental assumptions from which something is begun or developed or calculated or explained.</p></blockquote><p>Your groundwork is the work you do <b>before </b>you build your product.</p><p>It's similar to the work you'd do before you built a house. You'd ask questions like: "Who is the for? What do they desire in a home? What will they use it for? What neighborhood should it be in?"</p><p>Reach is leveraged by the foundation you set at the beginning:
      
      1. The market you choose (how cheap/easy are they to reach? do they pay for things?)
      
      2. The customer desire you choose to tackle (how strong is it?)
      
      3. The product you choose to build (does it satisfy the desire?)</p><p>https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1097165889445683200</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;"Do customers really want this? Do they care enough about this to switch to a new solution?"</p></blockquote><p><br></p>
