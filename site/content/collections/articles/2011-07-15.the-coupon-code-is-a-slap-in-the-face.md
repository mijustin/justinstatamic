    text: '<p>You want to pay for this product or service. You were prepared to pay the advertised price; now you know there is (or has been) a magical passcode that could get you a <strong>lower price</strong>. You fire up Google, and search: "product name, coupon code." You get pages of results: mostly garbage, some scams, and a few legitimate coupon sites. Unfortunately, the codes listed on those sites are a year old: <strong>you missed your chance.</strong></p><p><strong>Why do web apps and retailers do this to their <em>paying&nbsp;</em>customers?</strong>&nbsp;At the moment you''re actually ready to <strong>buy something</strong>&nbsp;you get a slap in the face:&nbsp;"You''re paying full price, but if you had our magic code you wouldn''t have to."</p><p>Simply put: this is bad customer service.</p><p>I''m not opposed to running a promotion, or offering a coupon. <strong>It''s the optics that matter</strong>. Instead of posting this constant reminder on your checkout page, remove the "Coupon code" field.</p><p>You can do this differently. <a href="https://plus.google.com/101333521287509975294/">Brad Sorensen</a> had these suggestions:</p><blockquote><p>Retailers would do better to give everyone a discount for a period or no one.</p><p>[Or] instead of coupon codes, they should have separate referrer URLs for people with the code so you don''t feel like the loser who didn''t get invited to the party.</p></blockquote><p>Exactly.</p><h3>Update (September, 2013):</h3><p><em>I originally wrote the post from an anecdotal POV. I''ve just now started digging into the research. Here''s what I''ve found so far:</em></p><ul><li>Oliver &amp; Shor found that: "prompting for a code in the absence of having one had negative effects on fairness, satisfaction, and completion when compared to the control." (<a href="http://www2.owen.vanderbilt.edu/mike.shor/research/promo/jpbm_reprint.pdf">Reference</a>)</li><li>This study by Oliver &amp; Swan (1989) found a big link between a consumer''s perception of pricing fairness, and their overall satisfaction with a purchase.
