      <p>Starting in 2008, <a href="http://adage.com/article/news/walmart-s-project-impact-redesign-takes-toll-sales/139759/">Wal-Mart embarked on an ambitious project</a> to improve the shopping experience in their stores. Code-named "Project Impact" the idea was to create a <strong>"better" </strong>Wal-Mart.</p>
      <p><strong>First, they sent out surveys.</strong> In the surveys, customers identified that they wanted cleaner, less cluttered stores. With this information in-hand, Wal-Mart began a huge multi-million dollar store refurbishment program. They slimmed down their inventory by 15%, redesigned shelves, and removed pallets from the aisles.</p>
      <p><strong>The result? Sales plummeted.</strong></p>
      <p><a href="http://dailyartifacts.com/walmarts-185-billon-dollar-mistake">Phil Terry estimates</a> that this experiment cost Wal-Mart at around $1.85 billion dollars. <a href="http://dailyartifacts.com/walmarts-185-billon-dollar-mistake">He explains what went wrong</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>[Wal-Mart] relied on what customers said in a survey versus what they actually do in the stores. What's easy to verbalize is not necessarily what's important</p></blockquote>
      <h3>People don't want always want the "better" solution</h3>
      <p>The technology industry is obsessed with making things better: make it faster, create a better design, add more features, give the user more power. So it's confusing to us when we build something "better" but customers don't buy it.</p>
      <p>How many times have we heard: "I'm building a better <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>" or "I'm building a better email client". These projects get released, but usually don't get anywhere. Why?</p>
      <h3>A fishing story</h3>
      <p>Let's say you've set out to build the best fishing lure ever made. You craft an aesthetic design, source high-quality materials, and design the hook so the fish is less likely to get away. <strong>You've done all this work but you've made a huge mistake: you haven't gone to see what fish are actually biting at</strong>. It doesn't matter how much "better" your lure is: if the fish aren't biting, you've wasted your time.</p>
      <p><strong>It's the same for customers.</strong> Instead of setting out to build something "better", we need to watch and <strong>see what customers are actually doing</strong>. Where are the fish biting? Some examples:</p>
      <p>"I just need an easy way to share big files." Boom! <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>
      <p>"I like sharing my photos and making them look cool." Bam! <a href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>"I want to edit my business website myself." Kapow! <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.</p>
      <h3>But people "should" do it my way!</h3>
      <p>The hardest part of this is resisting our urge to tell people "But this is the best way to do it!" It doesn't matter. We need to follow what people <strong>are doing </strong>as opposed to what we <strong>want them to do</strong>.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
