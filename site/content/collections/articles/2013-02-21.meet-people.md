      <p>Do you want to build relationships with interesting people?</p>
      <p>Here are some unique ways to meet new people, get out of your comfort zone, and have great conversations:</p>
      <h3>1. Buy someone lunch</h3>
      <p>There was a CEO that I really wanted to meet, but I was never able to connect with him at social events. So I wrote him an email with the subject line: "Can I buy you lunch?" In the email I said: "You're a business leader that I really respect. I want to get better at <i>x</i>. Can I take you for lunch?" He replied and said: "I'd love to go for lunch, but you don't have to buy."</p>
      <p>Everyone likes being taken to lunch. Be generous, and you could receive enjoyable company, and great advice, in return.</p>
      <h3>2. Start a podcast</h3>
      <p>This one isn't for everyone, but I've been able to have amazing conversations with interesting people through the podcast I run with Kyle Fox: <a href="http://productpeople.tv">Product People</a>. Podcasts are great, because you can choose a topic that you're passionate about, and then invite other people (that are passionate about the same thing) to join you as a guest.</p>
      <p>You don't need to be naturally outgoing or extroverted to podcast. Some of the best hosts I know are actually the opposite! <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/make-a-podcast-itunes/">Here's a good resource for getting started</a>.</p>
      <h3>3. Start your own meetup</h3>
      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/kevinhorek">Kevin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredbell">Jared</a> didn't like the other networking events in town, so they decided to start their own: <a href="http://nerdsnightout.ca/">Nerds Night Out</a>. Instead of doing the "normal" thing, and have a presenter, they just get together for drinks at a pub. They started small by inviting a few other people in the web development community. They told them they'd do it every month. It gradually grew, and now 10-25 people come each month.</p>
      <h3>4. Take a class; in a different city</h3>
      <p>One way to meet a completely new group of people is to take a class in a different city. <a href="http://blog.mailoutinteractive.com/post/Learning-to-program.aspx">I took a weekend "learn to code" class in Las Vegas</a>. It was actually easier meeting people as the "out-of-towner" because I was unique (I was the only non-local). I still keep in touch with people from this class.</p>
      <h3>5. Volunteer at an event</h3>
      <p>Every event organizer needs help: a photographer, a sound person, a host (to welcome people). When you volunteer, you get to meet the organizing team, and anyone attending the event (plus, you usually get to attend and participate for free).</p>
      <p>I built <a href="http://skieverest.ca">the website</a> for a fundraiser. <a href="https://twitter.com/peterurban">Peter</a> volunteered to <a href="http://www.mailoutinteractive.com/workshop/">do the video</a> for a workshop I was running. <strong>Here's a tip if you're a photographer:</strong> why not volunteer to take photos of attendees throughout the night? As you take photos, offer to email people their photographs. You've made a meaningful connection, and you have a great way to follow-up.</p>
      <h3>What's next?</h3>
