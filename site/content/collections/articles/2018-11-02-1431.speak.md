    text: '<h2>How I got into public speaking</h2><p>When I was younger, I was the shyest kid in my whole class.</p><p>I went to a French immersion school (that''s a thing in Canada), and every year we''d have "Concours <g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="31" data-gr-id="31">d’art</g> <g class="gr_ gr_32 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="32" data-gr-id="32">oratoire</g>." It was a public-speaking competition for students across the province.&nbsp;</p><p>"Concours" was mandatory, and I despised it. I''d have anxiety for weeks beforehand. When my turn came, I''d grit my teeth and just get through it as fast as possible (while staring at my shoes).</p><p>Fast forward to adulthood.</p><p><b>When I started my career, I realized that learning to speak publicly would be a critical skill. </b>Whether it was presenting to my dev team, giving a product demo, or speaking at a local meetup, I needed to know how to give a talk.</p>'

Then, I moved on to giving product demos.</p><p>Eventually, I put on a small workshop for our customers.</p><p>In 2011, I attended a Future of Web Apps conference in Miami and wondered, "could I speak on stage at a tech conference like this?"</p><p>I kept practicing. I spoke at local meetups and events.</p><p><b>And then, in 2015 I submitted an attendee talk for MicroConf in Las Vegas.</b>&nbsp;Other attendees got to vote on which talks they wanted to see. My topic was picked, and I gave my 12-minute talk on stage at a tech conference!</p><p>The organizers liked it so much, they asked me to be the keynote speaker at MicroConf in Barcelona that summer.</p>'

    text: '<h2>How to speak at a tech conference</h2><p>Public speaking, just like anything, is a skill you develop over time. Here are some best practices.<br></p><h3>Why do we give talks in the first place?</h3><p>Talks serve different purposes, depending on your role.</p><p><b>For conference organizers</b>&nbsp;"the talks" is what motivates people to buy tickets. Organizers want topics&nbsp;and speakers that are engaging. Ultimately, they want attendees to get value from the event (and come back next year).</p><p><b>Conference attendees</b>&nbsp;are looking for talks that will teach them something new, entertain them, and motivate them to act when they get home.</p><p><b>Conference speakers </b>have a variety of motivations. Every speaker needs to answer this question honestly:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"Why are you giving this talk? What do you want to <b>give</b>&nbsp;to attendees? What do you want to <b>receive</b>&nbsp;in return?</blockquote><h3>Think of your audience</h3><p>Knowing who you''re speaking to is the most important step of any talk. Your topic, content,&nbsp;and delivery all depend on who''s in the audience.</p><p>So start by taking out a piece of paper and writing out:</p><blockquote>Who am I speaking to?</blockquote><p>Remember: the talk isn''t <b>for</b>&nbsp;you. You''re trying to help attendees make progress in their lives.</p><p>Early on, you''ll want to identify different areas where the audience is struggling. Make a list!</p><h3>How to pick a topic for your talk</h3><p>Once you have a list of potential topics, you''ll want to narrow it down.</p><p>You''re looking for overlap between two areas:</p><ul><li>What does the audience want to learn?<br></li><li>What I am best equipped to teach?<br></li></ul><p>This doesn''t have to be scary! Adam Wathan was watching David Hemphill speak, and made this comment:</p><blockquote>I really like the format of David''s talk:&nbsp;<em>“Here are some interesting problems I’ve had to solve and how I solved them.”</em> Everyone learns something and it’s super practical.<br></blockquote><p>After watching hundreds of tech talks over the years, I''ve noticed that these types of talks resonate the most strongly:</p><ul><li>"Here''s a situation I was in, and how I made it better."<br></li><li>"Here''s something I accomplished and here''s how I did it..."<br></li><li>"Here''s my experience so far, and what I would have done differently..."<br></li></ul><h3>How to structure your talk</h3><h4>The rule of three</h4><p>Splitting your topic into three parts is a great way to structure a talk. It''s actually the format of Steve Jobs'' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">famous commencement speech</a>:</p><blockquote>Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</blockquote><p>Jobs used his three stories to illustrate his main point: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven''t found it yet, keep looking. Don''t settle."</p><p>Again, it doesn''t have to be three stories. It could be:</p><ul><li>Three tactics to try<br></li><li>Three ways to approach X<br></li><li>Three problems I solved<br></li><li>Three methods to test for X</li><li>How I use X to&nbsp;fix these three things</li></ul><h4>Focus on takeaways</h4><p>My favorite thing to do at a conference is to observe which slides get the most people to reach in their pockets, pull out their phones, and take a picture.</p><p>Attendees are looking for takeaways! Give them a practical action they can take home with them:</p><ul><li>"Run this test..."</li><li>"Do this action..."</li><li>"Try this hack..."</li><li>"Here''s a good tip..."</li><li>"Use this tool..."</li><li>"Reduce X by..."</li><li>"Focus on this..."</li><li>"Start with this template..."</li></ul><p>Here''s a great example from Patio11''s talk at MicroConf:</p>'
