      <em>**Here's an example:**</em>
      
      Most conference organizers put on a special reception for the speakers. I remember attending a speaker's dinner in Barcelona. When I walked in the room, I was greeted by some of the most brilliant people in my niche; folks I had admired for years.  I remember thinking: "Am I really sitting here, talking with these incredible people?"

    text: '<p>The connections Jon and I have made through conferences have been a massive help with&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor.fm</a>. One contact saved us months of work when he introduced us to someone at Spotify''s head office.</p><p>Likewise,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt">Stephanie Hurlburt</a>, a graphics engineer, says that public speaking has been a big sales channel for her company, Binomial:</p><blockquote>If we just look at the ratio of effort to impact, speaking at conferences is huge. You get wide reach, PR, credibility boost, &amp; lots of face-to-face time.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>It pays for geeks to learn public speaking skills; whether you''re looking to advance your career profile, or grow your company.</p><p>But how can you get from where you''re at now, to standing on stage and giving a talk with confidence?<br></p><p>Let''s talk about that.</p>'

    text: '<h2>First, let''s deal with your nerves</h2><p>For many, the idea of giving a talk is terrifying.</p><p>Lots of us geeks suffer from social anxiety. A majority of us are introverted.<br></p><p>There''s a myth that public speaking is only for overconfident extroverts. It''s not!</p><p>Everyone is awkward and nervous during their first talks. It''s something that improves with practice.</p>'

    text: '<h2>Next, let''s talk about the purpose of a conference talk</h2><p>Talks serve different functions, depending on your role. Understanding what organizers and attendees want will help you better craft your pitch.</p><p><b>Organizers</b>&nbsp;want people to buy tickets. Conference talks&nbsp;are the main event; they''re the reason people attend. So organizers want topics&nbsp;and speakers that will draw more attendees. Ultimately, they want attendees to get value from the event (and come back next year).</p><p><b>Conference attendees</b>&nbsp;are looking for talks that will teach them something new, entertain them, and motivate them to act when they get home.</p><p><b>Conference speakers </b>have a variety of motivations. Every speaker needs to answer this question honestly:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"Why are you giving this talk? What do you want to <b>give</b>&nbsp;to attendees? What do you want to <b>receive</b>&nbsp;in return?</blockquote><h2>Finally, let''s find you some speaking opportunities</h2><p>The best place to start? Start <b>now</b> and start <b>small</b>.</p>'

    text: '<p>Demo a new product feature to your team. Give a talk to your coworking buddies about something you''ve learned lately. Do a livestream and explain how to accomplish a specific task.<br></p><blockquote>Every time you give a talk, you become a better speaker!</blockquote><p>&nbsp;An event you''ve already attended.</p><p>Many conferences feature lightning talks, presented by attendees. Ideas are submitted before the event and are voted on by&nbsp;other conference-goers.</p><p><br></p><h2>How to pitch a talk idea</h2><h3>Think of your audience</h3><p>Knowing who you''re speaking to is the most important step of any talk. Your topic, content,&nbsp;and delivery all depend on who''s in the audience.</p><p>So start by taking out a piece of paper and writing out:</p><blockquote>Who is this event for?</blockquote><p>Remember: the talk isn''t <b>for</b>&nbsp;you. You''re trying to help attendees make progress in their lives.</p><p>Early on, you''ll want to identify different areas where the audience is struggling. Make a list!</p><h3>How to pick a topic for your talk</h3><p>Once you have a list of potential topics, you''ll want to narrow it down.</p><p>You''re looking for overlap between two areas:</p><ul><li>What does the audience want to learn?<br></li><li>What I am best equipped to teach?<br></li></ul><p>This doesn''t have to be scary! Adam Wathan was watching David Hemphill speak, and made this comment:</p><blockquote>I really like the format of David''s talk:&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúHere are some interesting problems I‚Äôve had to solve and how I solved them.‚Äù</em> Everyone learns something and it‚Äôs super practical.<br></blockquote><p>After watching hundreds of tech talks over the years, I''ve noticed that these types of talks resonate the most strongly:</p><ul><li>"Here''s a situation I was in, and how I made it better."<br></li><li>"Here''s something I accomplished and here''s how I did it..."<br></li><li>"Here''s my experience so far, and what I would have done differently..."<br></li></ul>'
