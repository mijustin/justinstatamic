      <p>One month ago, I went to New York City with my best friend.</p>
      <p>It was an incredible trip. I made memories there that I'll never forget.</p>
      <p>I was also there to speak at Laracon 2017. (<a href="https://youtu.be/YaHXZT6RNs8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can see a clip here</a>)</p>
      <p>At the conference, I met a guy named Yaz, who had built this cool app called ContestKit. People show me apps all the time, but I loved Yaz's one sentence description:</p>
      <p><em>"It's a way to create digital scratch and win tickets."</em></p>
      <p>His clients included a professional soccer team, who were using it to give out prizes during games.</p>
      <p>He asked me if I'd be interested in running my own contest.</p>
      <p>I knew I'd be releasing the new version of <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing for Developers</a> (my book) on August 31st.</p>
      <p>I thought it'd be fun to do a bunch of giveaways before then. So today I'm introducing my first:</p>
      <h3>Giveaway contest</h3>
