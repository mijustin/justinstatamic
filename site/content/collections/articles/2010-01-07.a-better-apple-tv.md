      <p>I'm a <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/yes-apple-tv/">big fan of the Apple TV</a>; not so much for what it is <strong>right now</strong> but more for what it <strong>could be</strong>. I think it's time we Apple TV users start cheering for a new upgrade.</p><p>Here's how to make the Apple TV better:<br>
      <strong></strong></p><h3><strong>Make it snappy</strong></h3><p>The controls on the Apple TV currently feel slow and cumbersome; things don't just "happen" when you click on them (there is often a delay).&nbsp; Speeding those response times up will give the regular couch potato the same feeling they get when flicking through channels.&nbsp; It needs to change from a "browsing" (web) paradigm to a "flicking" (TV) paradigm.<br>
      <strong></strong></p><h3><strong>Apple TV apps</strong></h3><p>Just like the iPhone, the Apple TV is ripe with potential for mini-applications that can be downloaded and enjoyed instantly.&nbsp; Here are a few app ideas I like:</p><p><strong>Games: </strong>it could be a gaming system if the games were played using your iPod touch/iPhone as a controller.&nbsp; Simple games, like Tetris, could use the existing Apple remote.<br>
      <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Social networking: </strong>see what people are <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=mad%20men">tweeting</a> about the current show you're watching, or maybe see <a href="http://www.strongmaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/movie.jpg">how you're friends on Facebook reviewed the movie</a> you're about to rent.<br>
      <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Boxee: </strong>come on Apple!&nbsp; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-16-boxee-box-by-d-link-review.html">These guys</a> have done all the hard work for you; just allow people to install it easily.<br>
      <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Keynote: </strong>display slideshows on your TV</p><p><strong>Video editing:</strong> this app allows you to create quick videos and slideshows on your TV screen<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Push notification: </strong>allows on-screen alerts for calendar events, new TV episodes,<br>
      <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Add the ability to view </strong><strong>streaming content</strong>: sports, news, and major events.&nbsp; These all need to be enjoyed in real-time.&nbsp; There are a dozen providers (like <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">Ustream</a> and <a href="http://www.justin.tv/">Justin.TV</a>).<br>
      <strong></strong></p><h3>Web browsing</h3><p>Using the iPhone or iPod touch as a touchpad and keyboard could actually make browsing the web on a TV screen a good experience.&nbsp; People are using their iPhone for browsing the net at home already; expanding that same type of experience to a bigger screen in the living room is a logical next step.</p><h3>Know your market (improve parental controls)</h3><p>After talking to a variety of Apple TV owners, I think Apple doesn't realize who the primary market for this device should be: families.&nbsp; My wife doesn't know what a torrent is, and doesn't want to watch movies on the computer.&nbsp; She wants to be able to sit down on the couch, and navigate a system that allows her to watch movies and TV: the Apple TV does that.&nbsp; My kids have their favorite TV shows (<a href="http://www.shaunthesheep.com/">Shawn the Sheep</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Pets">Wonder Pets</a> are two of them).&nbsp; They want to watch them over and over again.&nbsp; When we had to rely on DVDs, the discs would get scratched beyond use after a couple of months.&nbsp; On Apple TV we buy their favorite shows, and watch them as many times as we like, and there's no physical media that gets damaged.</p><p>Despite the fact that Apple TV is perfect for families, <strong>the parental controls are terrible</strong>.&nbsp; The new user interface from the latest update is slick, but it <a href="http://twitter.com/mijustin/status/5394870429">shows scary thumbnails at the top of the screen that can't be turned off</a>.&nbsp; Furthermore, while I can set parental controls for the movies and shows that I own, I can't control what movie trailers my kids could access (or even turn movie trailers off at all).&nbsp; These things need to be fixed.</p><h3>Quit calling it a hobby</h3><p>When <a href="http://www.last100.com/2007/05/31/steve-jobs-appletv-is-a-hobby/">Steve Jobs called the Apple TV a hobby</a>, he put a nail in the coffin before the device even had a chance.&nbsp; Steve: there is a lot of potential to reinvent the "TV world" the same way you did for mobile phones, and portable music players.&nbsp; Get off the "hobby train" and make it happen.</p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/what-is.html"><br></a> </p>
