      <p>Back in the Spring of 2015, I was chatting with Nathan Barry.</p>
      <p>He'd recently decided to leave his info-product business behind, and double-down on his SaaS (ConvertKit).</p>
      <p>At the time, the decision seemed ridiculous to me.</p>
      <p>I was working as a Product Manager for Sprintly but had just published <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>. I was eagerly anticipating a time where I'd be able to quit my job and go independent.</p>
      <p>To me, Nathan was living the dream. The year previously he'd done nearly $300,000 in revenue from books and courses.</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1783" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nathan-barry-net-income.png" alt="Nathan Barry net income" width="540" height="358" /></p>
      <p>As someone who was looking on longingly from the sidelines, I couldn't imagine leaving that kind of business behind.</p>
      <p>When I asked him about it, he replied:</p>
      <blockquote><p>There’s a bunch of reasons I decided to focus on ConvertKit. First, I needed a challenge. Second, <strong>I know people that have gotten to half a million or a couple million dollars a year in revenue off books and courses. And when I look at their business models, I just don’t like it.</strong> To get to $1 million in revenue you have to optimize just about everything. It’s diminishing returns; it’s like squeezing blood from a stone. To drive more revenue, you have to do more launches, and hire more people. Folks that are winning at info-products have huge monthly expenses and lower profit margins. With SaaS, I saw a substantial business I could grow for a long time.</p></blockquote>
      <p>I shook my head. It still seemed crazy to me. In 2014, ConvertKit had done about $39,000 in revenue (almost 8x less than his books). I just didn't get it.</p>
      <h3>Fast forward two years</h3>
      <p>I followed Nathan's playbook, and went independent in 2016, using <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a> and <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> as my platform. In 2017 I added <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> to my product mix.</p>
      <p>Revenue-wise, my little solo business did pretty well:</p>

      <p>But something else happened in my second year of business. Something I didn't expect. I got depressed. For the first time in my life, I was dealing with intense mental health issues. There were weeks where I was only able to work five hours total.</p>
      <p>There was a huge downside to solopreneurship that I hadn't considered: when you get sick, there's nobody else around to keep your business running. Most of my marketing, video tutorials, and coaching require me to be charismatic and energetic; there were many days where I just couldn't.</p>
      <p><strong>When the year ended, I was mentally and financially drained.</strong></p>
      <p>Thanks to therapy, I'm feeling a lot better now. But the experience moved me.</p>
      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>The past two years have taught me some valuable lessons:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>I've worked too hard, and haven't left enough margin in my life.</strong> Brennan Dunn warned me about this in a private conversation at MicroConf. I've been doing too much of the work myself, and haven't leveraged automation when I should have.</li>
      <li><strong>The info-products business is hard to scale.</strong> Doing courses, workshops, and books have helped me earn an independent income. I plan to continue doing it while we're building this new SaaS. But, like Nathan mentioned, scaling it is difficult. You're either on a never-ending hamster wheel of launches, or, you're investing in employees, sophisticated automation, and non-stop webinars.</li>
      <li><strong>I'm ready to partner up. </strong>I've always liked working alone. But my health scare this past year changed me. The advantage of having a partner, is you've got someone to lean on when times get tough.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The announcement: I'm building a new podcasting SaaS</h3>
      <p>It's called <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a>. It was started by my friend Jon Buda, in Chicago. I'm coming on as his co-founder.</p>
      <p>Jon and I were introduced in 2014 by our mutual friend Chase Reeves at XOXO in Portland. Here's a photo from the day we met:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1785" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jon-buda-justin-jackson-portland-xoxo-1024x476.jpeg" alt="Jon Buda and Justin Jackson, Portland, Oregon, XOXO Festival 2014" width="600" height="279" /></p>
      <p>At the time, I was writing Marketing for Devs. Jon was working on a podcasting app with someone else. He invited me to host my podcast with him.</p>
      <p>Before we left, we said: "Let's build something together someday."</p>
      <p>Jon's first partnership didn't work out. He eventually got a job doing full-stack web dev in Chicago. We kept in touch and met up again in 2015.</p>
      <p>In June 2016, we tried building a community platform. Ultimately, we decided not to move forward with the idea, but it gave us a chance to work together.</p>
      <p>Finally, in December 2017, Jon told me about a new podcasting project he'd started: <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor</a>. He was getting tired of working on it by himself. I was tired of working solo too. So we started talking about partnering up.</p>
      <p>We finished signing all the legal documents last week. We're now official co-founders!</p>
      <h3>What is Transistor.fm? How does it compare to other podcasting hosting apps?</h3>
      <p>Businesses like Basecamp, eBay, and Code Pen have discovered the power of having a branded podcast. Instead of running ads on someone else's show, they're investing in building their own audience.</p>
      <p><strong>We want to make Transistor the best way to create a podcast for your business.</strong></p>
      <p>We already have users!</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1786" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-07-at-10.55-AM-1024x412.png" alt="The Cards Against Humanity podcast hosted on Transistor.fm" width="600" height="241" /></a></p>
      <p>Cards Against Humanity was our first paying customer. Their show, <a href="http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">The Good News Podcast</a>, is hosted on Transistor.</p>
      <p>Since launching the beta in December, we're hosting a handful of shows, and have already served 2 million podcast downloads.</p>
      <p>We aim to help companies overcome the challenges of making a podcast. We want to help them create compelling content, build a podcast website, format their feed correctly, find listeners, and get a good return on their investment.</p>
      <h3>What's next?</h3>
      <p><span class=" author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z9z84zhz69z8n1jz81zz69zz70zz90zz67zsz78zz68zrz81zz122zz81zcz89zz122zmz89zw2z73zz81zz66zz90z">Jon and I have lots of plans for Transistor</span>. This will be a side-project for both of us in 2018. He'll continue to work full-time, and I'll continue to sell <a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com">my products</a>, and do <a href="https://megamaker.co/coaching">coaching</a> to pay the bills.</p>
      <p>One thing that excites me, especially for <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/motivation/">Tiny Wins</a> customers, is that I'll be able to use Transistor as a live case study for my tutorials. Everything I'm learning and applying on my SaaS, I'll be sharing.</p>
      <p>If you want to follow along with Transistor, subscribe to <a href="https://saas.transistor.fm/">our podcast</a>, follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/transistorfm">on Twitter</a>, or sign-up for our <a href="https://transistor.fm/">waiting list</a>.</p>
