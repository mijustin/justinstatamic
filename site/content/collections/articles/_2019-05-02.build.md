      <p>Tons of folks (including me) give this generic advice to first-time founders:</p><blockquote><p>"Make something people want!"</p></blockquote><p>So when I read Katelyn Bourgoin's <a href="https://twitter.com/KateBour/status/1123033705163915264">tweet</a>, it made me pause:</p><blockquote><p>Telling founders simply to “build something people want” is at best unhelpful... and at worst condescending.
      
      Founders are trying. Hard.
      
      Of course they WANT to build great products.
      
      Let’s stop spouting platitudes and start giving more actionable guidance, please.</p></blockquote><p>This is my first attempt to answer the question, "how do I build something people want?" If you have ideas on making this better, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">let me know</a>!</p><h2>First, the market you target matters</h2><p>You don't just want to build something that a few people want; you want to build something that a lot of people want.&nbsp;</p><p>Even a small bootstrapped company needs hundreds of customers. (Actually, most will need thousands.)</p><p>How do you get there? Let's work backwards:</p><ul><li>Let's say you want 1,000 customers.</li><li>If your trial to paid conversion rate is 40%, you'll need 2,500 trials.</li><li>If your visitor to trial conversion rate is 1%, you'll need 250,000 visitors.</li></ul><p>(This example assumes you require a credit card up-front, which dramatically reduces your trial to conversion rate. If you don't ask for credit card up front, your visitor to trial conversion rate should 5% or higher)</p><h3>Case study: Taylor Otwell</h3><p>Taylor started his SaaS career by launching an invoicing app. It didn't really get any traction.</p><p>Next, he built a tool for an audience he knew well: the PHP developers who were using his framework, <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"I didn't have any idea what to expect before I launched it, but <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/">Forge</a> was an immediate success. Within a month it had about 1,000 customers."</p></blockquote><p>I asked him:</p>

      **Me**: Why do you think Forge was immediately successful?
      
      **Taylor**: By that time, the audience for Laravel had grown steadily. I announced Forge at Laracon (our conference) in the USA and Europe. There were probably a thousand people who attended, and Forge was something they could all use. So, in retrospect, getting 1,000 customers was fairly achievable at the time given our audience.

One thing that''s been interesting for me is how different it feels to be in a big market with growing demand.</p><p>In previous projects, I had to use a lot of sophisticated marketing techniques to gain traction.&nbsp;</p><p>But right now, there''s lots of demand for podcast hosting, and it feels like we can''t keep up. It''s like we''ve been dropped in a rushing river, and our job is to paddle as hard as we can. It''s a totally different feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>For many founders, this is a hard truth to accept:&nbsp;<b>the momentum in your market matters</b>.</p><blockquote><p>"The market you’re in will determine most of your growth." – <a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavingia</a></p></blockquote><p>How do figure out if you have a good market? Here are some questions you can ask yourself:<br></p><ul><li>Who are the people that might be interested in what I''ve built?</li><li>How many of them are there?</li><li>How much momentum is there towards this type of product right now?</li></ul><p><br></p>'
