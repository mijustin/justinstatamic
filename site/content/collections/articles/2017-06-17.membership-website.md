      <p>Have you built an audience through your podcast, blog, or YouTube channel? Creating a membership website is a great way to start earning an independent income.</p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I've had three podcasts (<a href="http://megamaker.co/">MegaMaker</a>, Build &amp; Launch, and <a href="http://productpeople.tv/">Product People</a>) all focused on a very specific niche. They're for software developers, designers, and other makers who want to launch their own digital products (apps, software, courses).</p>
      <p>Here are things I tried that <strong>didn't work: </strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising. </strong>Attracting good advertisers is really difficult. In podcasting, there's only a handful of companies that sponsor (Casper, MailChimp, Squarespace, Freshbooks), and their minimum requirements for downloads keeps increasing.</li>
      <li><strong>Crowdfunding.</strong> I ran my own campaign using a WordPress plugin called <a href="http://ignitiondeck.com/id/">Ignition Deck</a>. The idea was that listeners could support future topics by sponsoring their favorite idea. I wouldn't do this one again. Most of the support came from a single advertiser who would have supported regardless.</li>
      <li><strong>Micro-sponsorships.</strong> The idea here was to allow people to sponsor for as little as $99<span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="4 clicks">4</span>. You really have to be aggressive to get <strong>any</strong> ad money. But, there are listeners who want to promote their projects, and would be willing to spend $99 to $199. I might try this approach again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's what I tried that <strong>did work: </strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Membership site. </strong>It's not easy to run an online community, but so far the benefits have outweighed the challenges. <a href="http://productpeople.club/">Here's my membership site</a>. The most challenging part was finding the right platform. That's what I'm going to talk about below!</li>
      <li><strong>Physical products. </strong>T-shirts, stickers, etc...</li>
      <li><strong>Digital products. </strong>Ebooks, online courses.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How much revenue can you earn from a membership website?</h2>
      <p>I initially launched <a href="https://productpeople.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://productpeople.club/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHG2ISrnjjsVK-kNowNs9a0e3QpGQ">Product People Club</a> as a side-project. Since then, it's earned nearly $76,000. This is way more revenue than advertising or anything else I've tried:</p>
      <div class="m_8935617447031594971gmail-lightbox-wrapper">
      <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1617 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/membership-site-revenue.png" alt="Revenue from a paid membership website" width="1474" height="546" /><br />
      The biggest benefit is I don't have to chase advertisers, or try to pump up my download numbers for my podcast.</p>
      <p>I can make the show my fans wants, and give them an opportunity to dive even deeper to the subject matter in the private forums.</p>
      <p>I highly recommend selling annual subscriptions instead of monthly. (I actually just switched to pay once for lifetime access)</p>
      <h2>Which community platform should you choose?</h2>
      <p>Last year I tried Mightybell and it was a disaster.I had high hopes for it, especially because it had chat + mobile app built-in. But it was plagued by bugs, and had a really bad UI. It may have improved since then, but our members really didn't like it.</p>
      <p>For context, here are the platforms I've tried:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Campfire</li>
      <li>BuddyPress (turns WordPress into social network)</li>
      <li>bbPress (WordPress forums)</li>
      <li>P2 (another WordPress update driven platform)</li>
      <li>Mightybell</li>
      <li><strong>Now: </strong>Discourse + Memberful</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to set up an online membership site</h2>
      <p>Here is the setup I use for my community, the <a href="https://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a>.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://memberful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://memberful.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEPDzucpDP5wipwiPbHvJKQfVihg"><span class="il">Memberful</span></a> is the main platform (billing, registration, renewals, etc...)</li>
      <li><span class="il">Memberful</span> automatically connects to <a href="http://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.discourse.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiZ-0nufv1pgcP0ACesKqafuD32w"><span class="il">Discourse</span></a> forums, which I host on <a href="https://m.do.co/c/d12c8c2c375a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://m.do.co/c/d12c8c2c375a&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkdikOiUjbTYA_R9T7h282FxCS7g">Digital Ocean</a>.</li>
      <li><span class="il">Memberful</span> automatically adds members to my <a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://mailchimp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497809073146000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKKChpniXxuRZGZUx27xE0NqHX8Q">MailChimp</a> mailing list. I use this to send members a welcome email with a free download + a weekly newsletter.</li>
      <li><span class="il">Memberful</span> also allows you offer exclusive digital downloads for your members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Memberful basically got my business back because of Discourse. They make it easy to accept payment + integrated with Discourse and MailChimp.</p>
      <p>Once a new member signs up, they get this is the automated sequence:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=8cb83b3f841a6035fab28a85e&amp;id=ac0a0181a0&amp;e=0753f272b1">Day 1: Welcome!</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=8cb83b3f841a6035fab28a85e&amp;id=32bc880b86&amp;e=ed049b6c66">Day 3: Share in the forum</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to launch a membership website</h2>
      <p>It's very difficult to create an online community if you haven't first built up an audience.</p>
      <p>My recommendation: create a landing page (<a href="https://productpeople.club">like this</a>) and create a waiting list. 1,000 email addresses is a good benchmark for when to launch. Only open up 10 spots at a time, so you can personally onboard new members and get the discussion going.</p>
