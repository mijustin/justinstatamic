    text: '<p>Last year, around this time, my <a href="/2018-review">year-in-review</a> was an admission that life can be hard. 2017 and 2018 were difficult years for me. I wasn''t feeling like a winner.</p><p>But those difficult years lead to some key realizations:</p><ol><li>Discomfort is the key to personal growth. We need periods of being uncomfortable.</li><li>Making small improvements each day is the best way to create long-term results.</li><li>Confronting hard truths in the present pays long-term dividends.</li></ol><p>In 2019, I was fortunate to have a <b>good year</b>. Here''s what happened.</p><h2>Key learnings in 2019</h2><ul><li>"The market you''re in will determine most of your growth." â€“ <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1207333860268077058">Sahil Lavingia</a>&nbsp;(The market you choose matters!)</li><li>Cynicism kills progress. (<a href="/cynical">Source</a>)</li><li>Everything you implement will need to be maintained. (<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1207691055404965888">Source</a>)</li><li>Most worthwhile accomplishments are a long time in the making.&nbsp;</li><li>It''s OK to move on. (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/moving-on">Source</a>)</li></ul><h2>What went well in 2019</h2><h3>Full-time on Transistor.fm</h3><p>My plan for 2019 was to spend most of my time and energy on <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>. I wasn''t exactly sure how I was going to accomplish that.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, we had $5,000 in monthly recurring revenue; not nearly enough to replace the income Jon and I were earning from our full-time gigs.</p><p>But, we were growing fast (sometimes up to 29% month-over-month). For me personally, I felt my future was in SaaS, not in my old business (online courses).</p><p>So, even though I wasn''t being paid, I focused about 90% of my time on Transistor.</p><p>In April, we hit $10k in MRR, and we started paying me a regular (albeit small) monthly salary. Now it was official: I was full-time on Transistor.</p><p>Three months later (when we reached $19k MRR), Jon quit his full-time job at Cards Against Humanity and joined me.</p>'

    text: '<p>Since then, MRR has continued to grow. In the last quarter of 2019, we''ve been able to pay ourselves the equivalent of what we''d be making in our old full-time tech jobs.</p><p>Success really is "<a href="/disney">gradual and then sudden</a>." At the beginning of the year, the idea of going full-time on Transistor still felt like a pipe dream. But all that momentum we''d created previously started yielding impressive results for us this year. We passed the milestone that so many indie bootstrappers aspire for: earning a full-time income from our software product.</p><p>We don''t take this lightly. We''re incredibly grateful to the thousands of customers, fans, and supporters that helped get us here. We know we''ve been fortunate, and in 2020 we want to pass that good fortune on to others.</p><h3>What else made me happy?</h3><p><b>Doing less</b>. I shut down tons of projects and products I''d been running. I cancelled 10+ domain names. I finally deleted 25 old WordPress installs and cancelled my Mediatemple account. I didn''t take on any consulting work. I didn''t run a Black Friday sale.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Less financial stress.</b>&nbsp;Earning more with Transistor translated into a noticeable calm in my life. I paid off my line of credit that had been hanging over my head. I didn''t feel like I needed to hustle as much.</p>'
