    text: '<p>Last year, around this time, my <a href="/2018-review">year-in-review</a> was an admission that life can be hard. 2017 and 2018 were difficult years for me. I wasn''t feeling like a winner.</p><p>But those difficult years lead to some key realizations:</p><ol><li>Discomfort is the key to personal growth. We need periods of being uncomfortable.</li><li>Making small improvements each day is the best way to create long-term results.</li><li>Confronting hard truths in the present pays long-term dividends.</li></ol><p>In 2019, I was fortunate to have a <b>good year</b>. Here''s what happened.</p><h2>Key learnings in 2019</h2><ul><li>"The market you''re in will determine most of your growth." â€“ <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1207333860268077058">Sahil Lavingia</a>&nbsp;(The market you choose matters!)</li><li>Cynicism kills progress. (<a href="/cynical">Source</a>)</li><li>Everything you implement will need to be maintained. (<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1207691055404965888">Source</a>)</li><li>Most worthwhile accomplishments are a long time in the making.&nbsp;</li><li>It''s OK to move on. (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/moving-on">Source</a>)</li></ul><h2>What went well in 2019</h2><h3>Full-time on Transistor.fm</h3><p>My plan for 2019 was to spend most of my time and energy on <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>. I wasn''t exactly sure how I was going to accomplish that.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, we had $5,000 in monthly recurring revenue; not nearly enough to replace the income Jon and I were earning from our full-time gigs.</p><p>But, we were growing fast (sometimes up to 29% month-over-month). For me personally, I felt my future was in SaaS, not in my old business (online courses).</p><p>So, even though I wasn''t being paid, I focused more and more of my time on growing Transistor.</p>'
