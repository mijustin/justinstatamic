      <p>This is the mental image we need to have when we're launching new products: who would line up for this today, money in hand?</p><h2>How do know if there will be demand for your product?</h2><p>But how do you know, before you've launched something if people will want it?</p><p>The second question I ask when evaluating a new product idea is:</p><blockquote><p>What are the top five products these customers already pay for?</p></blockquote><p>There should be evidence that folks are already spending money in the space you’re thinking of entering.</p><p>For example, if you're targeting small SaaS companies, with 1-10 employees, go out and ask them: "What kinds of things are you paying for currently?"</p><p>My guess is they're paying for stuff like this:</p><ol><li>Hosting (Digital Ocean, AWS, Heroku, WPengine, Flywheel)</li><li>Marketing (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, Mixpanel, Buffer)</li><li>Messaging (Intercom, Gmail, Superhuman)</li><li>Office tools (Slack, Clubhouse, Basecamp, Gsuite, Excel, Calendar)</li><li>Finance (WaveApps, Baremetrics, Quickbooks, Bench)</li><li>Hardware (iPhones, iMacs, Macbooks, Surface)</li></ol><p>If you're launching something for small SaaS companies, and you product isn't in one of these categories,&nbsp;</p><p>Look for categories where people/businesses are already spending money.
      
      From an entrepreneur’s POV, if folks are willing to spend money on it, it’s a problem worth solving.</p>
