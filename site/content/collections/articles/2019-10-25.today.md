      <p>This is the mental image we need to have when we're launching new products: who would line up for this today, money in hand?</p><h2>How do know if there will be demand for your product?</h2><p>But how do you know, before you've launched something if people will want it?</p><p>One way of evaluating a new market is asking:</p><blockquote><p>What are the top five products these customers already pay for?</p></blockquote><p>There should be evidence that folks are already spending money in the space you’re thinking of entering.</p><p>For example, if you're targeting small SaaS companies, with 1-10 employees, go out and ask them: "What kinds of things are you paying for currently?"</p><p>My guess is they're paying for stuff like this:</p><ol><li>Hosting (Digital Ocean, AWS, Heroku, WPengine, Flywheel)</li><li>Marketing (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, Mixpanel, Buffer)</li><li>Messaging (Intercom, Gmail, Superhuman)</li><li>Office tools (Slack, Clubhouse, Basecamp, Gsuite, Excel, Calendar)</li><li>Finance (WaveApps, Baremetrics, Quickbooks, Bench)</li><li>Hardware (iPhones, iMacs, Macbooks, Surface)</li></ol><p>If you're launching something for small SaaS companies, and your product isn't in one of these categories, there's likely no market for it.</p><p>Founders should look for categories where folks are already spending money.</p><p>Before Airbnb launched in 2008, folks were already paying to stay at hotels, B&amp;Bs, cottages, vacation homes, and hostels. These days, annual spending on travel accommodation is $570 billion worldwide.</p><p>If folks are already spending money on it, it’s a problem worth solving.</p><h2>Look to past behavior</h2><p>Authors like Rob Fitzpatrick (<a href="http://momtestbook.com/">the Mom Test</a>), advises that when we interview potential customers, we should "get specific about examples in the past to get real, concrete data."</p><p>He recommends asking questions like:</p><blockquote><p>"What are they using now? How much does it cost and what do they love or hate about it? How much would those fixes be worth and how traumatic would it be for them to switch to a new solution?"&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The idea is that a potential customer's past or current behavior is a pretty good indicator of what they'll do in the future.</p><p>And, scientific research backs this up:</p><blockquote><p>"Researchers have argued that it is important to consider the role of past
      behavior when the behavior in question is performed repeatedly because past behavior is a stronger predictor of future
      actions for frequently performed behaviors than for infrequently performed
      behaviors." (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.475.5975&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p><br></p>
