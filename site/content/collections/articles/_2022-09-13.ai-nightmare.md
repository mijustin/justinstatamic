      <h2>AI-driven content is unhealthy for consumers</h2><p>When I use an app like TikTok, it “entertains” me for hours. But I wouldn’t describe that experience as healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, if you make junk food&nbsp;<b>designed&nbsp;to be addictive</b>&nbsp;people will consume large amounts of it.
      
      And yes, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, etc will make more money and make shareholders happy.
      
      But that's not a net positive for society.</p><p>What's even more concerning is <b>who will control this AI-driven future</b>. As <a href="https://oa.transistor.fm/episodes/michael-mignano-on-the-end-of-social-media-and-the-rise-of-recommendation-media">Michael Mignano said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"The platforms that will be most successful here are the ones with A) the most data, and B) the most computing power. If recommendation media is all about making AI-informed recommendations, basically <b>the platform with the most computing power wins</b>."</p></blockquote><p>So we're forecasting a future where we're all addicted to AI-driven content, where companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon own the algorithm? No thanks.</p><p>Giving people a never-ending stream of content designed to keep them on a centralized platform longer where the algorithm is controlled by some megacorp (and its shareholders) isn’t my idea of a great future.
      It’s fucking dystopian.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, we need less content delivered by algorithm; we need more calm, more "slow" media.</p><h2>AI-driven content is a bad deal for creators</h2><p>I think creators have always had a "bad deal" from social media platforms: we provide the content for free/low cost, we upload our address books, we cross-promote on other platforms, etc. But that deal will go from bad to worse in an AI-driven world.</p><p>In the old world, a creator would put a ton of time, energy, and money into making a YouTube video. If they were lucky, they might get $100 for the effort, but at least they were rewarded with "followers."&nbsp;</p><p>In the new AI-driven world, you make a viral video and get no followers. In an AI-driven world, people follow the algorithm, not the creator.</p><p><br></p>
