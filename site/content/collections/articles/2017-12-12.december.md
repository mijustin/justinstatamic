      <p>If you're experiencing the "December blues," you're not alone! The end of the year is demanding for a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>You're reflective.</strong>&nbsp;You're reviewing the good and the bad from 2017.</li><li><strong>You're thinking about 2018.&nbsp;</strong>The new year is just weeks away, and you're already making plans.</li></ol><p>Plus:&nbsp;<strong>December is busy</strong>. Personally, you're shopping, and going to holiday events. Professionally, you've got tons of work to do!</p><p>It's no wonder we're overwhelmed.</p><h3>How to finish the year strong</h3><p><strong>You have about 8 work days left before Christmas day.</strong>&nbsp;That's enough time for one last sprint before the new year.</p><p>Here's a plan that's worked for me:</p><ol><li><strong>Choose one project to finish.</strong>&nbsp;You're not going to complete everything before 2018. Look at your project list, and pick one thing you can&nbsp;<em>reasonably&nbsp;</em>complete. Remember, 8 days isn't a lot of time!</li><li><strong>Write a mini year-in-review</strong>. Take out a notepad, and write: "What are three things I'm thankful for this year?" In bullet form, list three things. Under that, ask yourself: "What are three things I'd like to improve next year?" Write out a few ideas for 2018.</li><li><strong>Do one thing to prepare for 2018.</strong>&nbsp;Now is a good time to connect with your coach, or your accountability group, and share your year-in-review. Let them suggest some practical steps you can take in January.</li></ol><p>This framework has helped me to be&nbsp;<strong>realistic&nbsp;</strong>about what I can finish. It also allows me to be&nbsp;<strong>reflective&nbsp;</strong>without being overwhelmed. And finally, it enables me to&nbsp;<strong>prepare&nbsp;</strong>for the new year, with a list of things I can start doing on January 2nd.</p><p>The best part?&nbsp;<strong>It's helped me to&nbsp;<em>enjoy&nbsp;</em>the holidays!&nbsp;</strong>Instead of feeling guilty about not getting enough work done, or being stressed about the new year, I can relax.</p><p><strong>You need to relax too!</strong></p><p>So, let's take the next week to&nbsp;<em>work hard</em>,&nbsp;<em>reflect</em>, and&nbsp;<em>prepare</em>.</p><p>And after that... sit down with a hot drink and enjoy the warmth of the season.</p><p>Cheers!<br>
