      <p>Today, in the Slack chat, Ashley shared an honest admission:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1724" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashley.png" alt="Ashley Baxter in Slack chat" width="573" height="100" /></p>
      <p>It's reassuring being in a community like <a href="https://megamaker.co/club" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MM Club</a> because you realize you're not alone. Other members jumped in:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1725" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/next1.png" alt="I've been feeling that way recently as well. It usually happens at this time of the year for me - I struggle to keep momentum with day to day tasks" width="511" height="96" /></p>
      <p>It seems like everyone is feeling it:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/next3.png" alt="I've been feeling it since October. Maybe my battery is running out." width="492" height="121" /></p>
      <p>If you're experiencing the "December blues," you're not alone! The end of the year is demanding for a couple of reasons:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>You're reflective.</strong> You're reviewing the good and the bad from 2017.</li>
      <li><strong>You're thinking about 2018. </strong>The new year is just weeks away, and you're already making plans.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Plus: <strong>December is busy</strong>. Personally, you're shopping, and going to holiday events. Professionally, you've got tons of work to do!</p>
      <p>It's no wonder we're overwhelmed.</p>
      <h3>How to finish the year strong</h3>
      <p><strong>You have about 8 work days left before Christmas day.</strong> That's enough time for one last sprint before the new year.</p>
      <p>Here's a plan that's worked for me:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Choose one project to finish.</strong> You're not going to complete everything before 2018. Look at your project list, and pick one thing you can <em>reasonably </em>complete. Remember, 8 days isn't a lot of time!</li>
      <li><strong>Write a mini year-in-review</strong>. Take out a notepad, and write: "What are three things I'm thankful for this year?" In bullet form, list three things. Under that, ask yourself: "What are three things I'd like to improve next year?" Write out a few ideas for 2018.</li>
      <li><strong>Do one thing to prepare for 2018.</strong> Now is a good time to connect with your coach, or your accountability group, and share your year-in-review. Let them suggest some practical steps you can take in January.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This framework has helped me to be <strong>realistic </strong>about what I can finish. It also allows me to be <strong>reflective </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space">without being overwhelmed. And finally, it enables me to <strong>prepare </strong>for the new year</span>, with a list of things I can start doing on January 2nd.</p>
      <p>The best part? <strong>It's helped me to <em>enjoy </em>the holidays! </strong>Instead of feeling guilty about not getting enough work done, or being stressed about the new year, I can relax.</p>
      <p><strong>You need to relax too!</strong></p>
      <p>So, let's take the next week to <em>work hard</em>, <em>reflect</em>, and <em>prepare</em>.</p>
      <p>And after that... sit down with a hot drink and enjoy the warmth of the season.</p>
      <p>Cheers!<br />
