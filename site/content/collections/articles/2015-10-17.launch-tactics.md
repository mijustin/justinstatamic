      <p>I just released my new book, <a href="http://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a>. The experience is still fresh in my mind, and I wanted to share <em>three simple tactics</em> that worked for me that you can use for your next launch.</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <h3>Identify a real pain point</h3>
      <p>By the time I sat down to create Marketing for Developers, I had hundreds of reference points like this:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1210 size-full" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/now-I-need-to-promote-my-product-large1.png" alt="I've built my product, that was the easy part, now I need to promote it." width="1300" height="292" /></p>
      <p>The biggest mistake we can make <em>is to create something that people don't want</em>. How do you avoid this? <strong>You embed yourself in a community, and you listen.</strong> Be patient. It might takes months of listening before you start noticing patterns.</p>
      <p>Finding a problem worth solving takes time, but it pays dividends when it comes time to promote your product; you'll have the confidence that there's demand for what you've created.</p>
      <h3>Your email list is your best friend</h3>
      <p>I still haven't found a channel that converts better than email. As an example, here's a snapshot of my conversions for Marketing for Developers:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1208" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/conversion-large.png" alt="What marketing channel converts the best? Email." width="852" height="518" /></p>
      <p>My email list had a 24% conversion rate [1. The conversion rate here is calculated as: "those that clicked the link, and bought." The percentage of people on the overall launch list that bought was 16%, which is still impressive.], and accounted for over 80% of my revenue. That's huge! As a comparison, Twitter had a 6.5% conversion rate and accounted for 0.4% of revenue.</p>
      <p>Once you're identified a <em>problem worth solving,</em> the first thing you should do is set up a <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/levelshtml">landing page</a> with a subscription form. Build that launch list!</p>
      <h3>Set a deadline</h3>
      <p>Two months before I released the book, I was floundering. I was 90% finished the project, but that last 10% was taking me <em>forever </em>(sound familiar?). I'd forgotten a crucial piece of startup wisdom:</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/382368305526611968"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1209 size-full" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/set-a-deadline.png" alt="&quot;When you set a deadline, you gain clarity&quot; - Jason Fried, DHH" width="946" height="308" /></a></p>
      <p>Once I set my deadline everything changed. I knew that every day that passed brought me closer to launch. I couldn't afford to waste days.</p>
      <p>Vague launch plans like "I'll launch sometime next year" aren't good enough. Put a date in the calendar. In fact you might want to have three launch stages:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Friends and advisors.</li>
      <li>Beta access.</li>
      <li>Official launch.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For big projects, 3 months in-between each of those stages is a good idea. Smaller projects could probably do each subsequent launch every 1-3 weeks.</p>
