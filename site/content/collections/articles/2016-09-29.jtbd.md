      <p>Recently, I had a chatÂ with Alan Klement about Jobs to be Done. Alan is <a href="http://www.whencoffeeandkalecompete.com/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=megamaker">writing a book on the topic</a>, it's probably the best thing I've read this year.</p>
      <p>Here's our conversation:</p>
      <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
      <div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYF6laKERh8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <p>We cover the following topics:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What is Jobs to be Done?</li>
      <li>How does JTBD help us understand customer motivation?</li>
      <li>How does JTBD help us build better products?
      <ul>
      <li>B2C example. Wy does someone upgrade to the iPhone 7?</li>
      <li>B2B example. Why does someone hire MailChimp?</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How to unearth the struggle that customers are having.</li>
      <li>How to see opportunities for un-met jobs, and how to avoid tunnel vision ("We build CRM software, and that's all customers will ever need.")</li>
      <li>How do we transition from JTBD to product development and marketing? How does the handoff work?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are a few notes:</p>
