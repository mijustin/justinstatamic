    text: '<p>37signals caused quite a commotion this past week when they released <a href="http://37signals.com/draft">their first iPad app, Draft</a>.&nbsp; Draft is a simple sketching tool, that allows you to draw in white or red (only two colors) on a black canvas.&nbsp; You can then share the sketches via email or directly to your <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> account.</p><p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad">On their blog</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere, there was a lot of pushback on the features (or lack of) and the price ($9.99).&nbsp; We''re not talking about a few comments but about <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad?179#comments">many people</a> who were riled up.</p><p><strong>I decided to cut through all the noise and buy the app.</strong> I compared it to another free app from Adobe called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/adobe-ideas-1-0-for-ipad/id364617858?mt=8"><em>Ideas</em></a>. &nbsp;Here is the video review:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My conclusion? </strong><em>Draft </em>makes a lot of sense if you use Campfire. &nbsp;You can share sketches instantly in any Campfire room. &nbsp;If you''re a designer or company that uses Campfire, the $10 price tag is irrelevant; the app will pay for itself in saved time. </p>'
