      <p>37signals caused quite a commotion this past week when they released <a href="http://37signals.com/draft">their first app for the iPad, called Draft</a>.  Draft is a simple sketching tool, that allows you to draw in white or red (only two colors) on a black canvas.  You can then share the sketches via email or directly to your <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> account.</p>
      <p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad">On their blog</a>, and elsewhere, there was a lot of push-back on the features (or lack of) and the price ($9.99).  We're not talking about a few comments; we're talking about <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad?179#comments">a lot of people</a> who were really riled up.</p>
      <p><strong>I decided to cut through all the noise and buy the app.</strong> I compared it to another, free, app from Adobe called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/adobe-ideas-1-0-for-ipad/id364617858?mt=8"><em>Ideas</em></a>.  Here is the video review:</p>
      <p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NKXrbaK4yx0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NKXrbaK4yx0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
      <p><strong>My conclusion? </strong><em>Draft </em>makes a lot of sense if you use Campfire.  You can share sketches instantly to any Campfire room.  If you're a designer, or company, that uses Campfire, the $10 price tag is irrelevant; the app will definitely pay for itself in saved time. </p>
