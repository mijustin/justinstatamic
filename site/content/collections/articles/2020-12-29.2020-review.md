      **Before I go too much further. I want to acknowledge that a lot of 2020 sucked.** Coronavirus ravaged every country in the world. Millions of people, including my uncle, died from the virus. Many people lost their jobs, and many small businesses were forced to close. Kids were forced to stay home from school, and couldn't hang out with their friends. I haven't been able to see my family in Alberta this year, and it's been brutal.
      
      It feels weird for my breakthrough year to come at this time.

      <h2>Key insights from 2020</h2><ul><li><b><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/margin">Good businesses have margin</a>. </b>Yes, profit margin. But also margin for your time, your emotional and physical health, your relationships, your sanity, and your integrity.</li><li><b><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/surfing">Business is like surfing</a>.</b> Surfing is mostly about being in the water, paddling, and waiting for the right wave.</li><li><b><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/good-ideas">Ideas matter</a>.</b> People say "execution is everything," but I disagree.</li><li><b><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/main-street-fights-back">Main street businesses need leverage</a>.</b> That leverage will come from networking themselves together.</li><li><b><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/cure">Basic needs come first</a></b>. Our society needs to do a better job of caring for people and providing them with the fundamentals to thrive.</li></ul><h2>What went well in 2020</h2><h3>Transistor.fm hits its stride</h3><p>In 2019, Jon (my co-founder) and I had started paying ourselves a regular paycheck. Transistor essentially replaced our old jobs.<br></p><p>But, a business shouldn't just replace your old income. Starting a business has serious opportunity costs, as Josh Kaufman <a href="https://personalmba.com/opportunity-cost/#:~:text=Josh%20Kaufman%20Explains%20'Opportunity%20Cost'&amp;text=Starting%20the%20business%20will%20certainly,up%20by%20making%20a%20Decision.">explains here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Letâ€™s say you decide to quit your $50,000/year job and start a business. Starting the business will certainly have costs of its own, but it will also cost you the $50,000 you would have made had you stayed at your job.</p></blockquote><p>Every time we start something new, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1334271174956568577">we're making a bet</a>.
      
      We're risking our time, money, and energy. Every idea we commit to has huge opportunity costs. If you spend 5 years building something that doesn't work, you've lost 5 years of investing in your career, family, etc.</p><p>In previous years, my businesses made enough money for us to live on, but nothing more. My rationalization was, "My lifestyle is way better, so who cares about my bank balance?"</p><p>But when I got depressed in 2017, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/2018-review">it nearly destroyed me financially</a>. Money provides security. Money provides margin.
      
      You want both: money + lifestyle.
      
      (Don't sacrifice either for the other!)</p><p>So, eventually, your business should provide you with a significant return on investment. You need to be compensated for all the "years in the desert:"</p><ul><li>Ideas that didn't work out</li><li>Times where you didn't get paid enough</li><li>Money, time, and resources you invested</li></ul><p>in 2020, Jon and I were fortunate to be able to do just that.&nbsp;</p><p>For me personally, it's meant I've been able to start saving for retirement again. I've re-built most of my savings. I'm regularly contributing to an investment account. I still have a lot of catching-up to do, but it feels great to have the margin to invest in myself again.</p><p>When the initial Covid-19 lockdown happened in March, many people had the time to start that podcast they'd been dreaming about. As a result, there was a rush on microphones (Amazon sold out), remote recording software (I've heard Squadcast 10x'd revenue), and, yes,&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">podcast hosting and analytics</a>.</p><p>But, despite having record-breaking months in April and May, our growth chart still gradual and steady:</p>
