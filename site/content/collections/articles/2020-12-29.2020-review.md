      **So much of 2020 sucked.** Coronavirus ravaged every country in the world. Millions of people, including my uncle, died from the virus. Many people lost their jobs, and many small businesses were forced to close. Kids were forced to stay home from school, and couldn't hang out with their friends. I haven't been able to see my family in Alberta this year, and it's brutal.
      
      It feels weird for my breakthrough year to come at this time.
