      <p>Back in 2008, I was frustrated and stuck.</p>
      <p>Every morning, I'd drive one hour downtown to work. Every evening, it was an hour home. 2 hours a day. 10 hours a week.</p>
      <p>That long commute was killing me.</p>
      <p>I started listening to podcasts and discovered folks like Rob Walling (Drip), Jason Fried (Basecamp), Nathan Barry (ConvertKit).</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">It felt like they were living life on their own terms.</strong></p>
      <p>But how could I, a guy sitting in his car, get to where they were at? It seemed impossible.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"I think most of us would be well-served by ignoring the advice of the super-winners, and instead seeking out &amp; learning from those who are (at most) 1-3 "steps" ahead of us on the journey.<span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">" – <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_hawk">Chris Hawkins</a></span></p></blockquote>
      <h3>Learn from Darian Rosebrook's story</h3>
      <p><a href="https://compassofdesign.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/darian-rosebrook-designer.png" alt="Darian Rosebrook, Designer" width="1014" height="243" /></a></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Darian is a designer living in Mt Vernon, Washington. He had the same challenges as me: a day job that took most of his time, and a new baby at home. But his dream was to build an audience and become an independent maker.</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">So what did he do? <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">He started small</strong>.</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">He looked on his hard drive, and found two design assets he'd used for other projects:</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://buy.compassofdesign.com/topographic-vectors-and-images">Topographic map vectors</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://buy.compassofdesign.com/hi-resolution-dry-brushed-ink-textures">A collection of Photoshop ink brushes</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>He decided to put them up for sale on <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>, at $10 each.</p>
      <p>To promote it, he posted it on <a href="https://compassofdesign.com/">his website</a>. He also told friends in a Slack group about it, and posted a few tweets.</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">What happened?</strong></p>
      <p>He earned his first dollars on the internet!</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Getting those first sales was enough for me to believe that I can actually make something people are willing to pay money for. I was fairly unknown in the design space too, so it was surprising." – <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian</a></p></blockquote>
      <p><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Here's what he learned:</strong></span></p>
      <blockquote><p>"You'd be surprised how many things you make in in client work that could be turned into a product. Even old pieces from other designs that are just lying around on my desktop or client folders." – <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian</a></p></blockquote>
      <p>The key is to <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">just get started</strong>. Doing <em data-redactor-tag="em">something</em> is better than sitting in your car and doing <em data-redactor-tag="em">nothing</em><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">. Now that Darian's launched his first products, he's closer to his goal of quitting his day job. It might take 2-3 more years of working at it, but that's better than waiting forever!</span></p>
      <h3>What should you do?</h3>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">1. Look through your hard drive</strong></p>
      <p>You might already have assets that you could turn into a small product! Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">An Excel sheet that you use to calculate cash flow</span></li>
      <li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">A PDF checklist you use before you launch a new project</span></li>
      <li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Photographs that could be used as stock images</span></li>
      <li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Music you've composed that someone could use on their podcast</span></li>
      <li><span data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-style="background-color: initial;">Old sketches you made for a client, but they never used</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">2. Turn those assets into a sellable product</strong></p>
      <p>Now it's time to take the item you'd like to sell and put some polish on it!</p>
      <p>For Darian, this meant cleaning up his illustrations, and creating the .ai, .svg, .png, .jpg files.</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">3. Get a digital storefront</strong></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">I recommend using <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>. They'll give you a product page, host your files, and handle the checkout and delivery process.</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Upload your files, upload a header image, and set a price!</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">4. Promote your product</strong></span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">To make sales, you'll need to get the word out. Here are a few channels to try:</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Online communities, Slack chats, Facebook Groups, and forums</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.designernews.co/badges/show">"Show DN"</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/show">"Show HN"</a>, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a></li>
      <li>Your mailing list or Twitter audience</li>
      <li>Your friend's mailing list, or Twitter audience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you get to this stage, please reply to this email and let me know! I'd love to help you get the word out.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
