      <p>As I'm ramping up for the launch of the <em>Build your Audience </em>course on Tuesday, July 29th (that's tomorrow!) I keep thinking about this question:</p>
      <p><strong><em>Is it harder to build an audience today, than it was 10 years ago?</em></strong></p>
      <p>I was listening to Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann, and they spoke about this very topic (<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/179">episode 179</a>, if you're interested).</p>
      <p>This quote from Dan especially stood out:</p>
      <blockquote><p><em>“For a long time, it seemed like things were figured out. If you wanted to get the word out, you started a blog. This was the path. It doesn’t seem like that’s possible anymore. How would you become the next <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Gruber</a> today? Could you go and start a blog today (with the goal of doing it for a living) if you weren’t already a super-known person? Because 10 years ago you could! It’s really hard these days for people who don’t already have a following to get that credibility.”</em></p></blockquote>
      <p>To which Merlin replied:</p>
      <blockquote><p><em>“It was a smaller field of competitors back then. It’s way harder to get traffic today.”</em></p></blockquote>
      <p>Has it changed?</p>
      <p>Definitely. Here we have two people (with considerable audiences themselves) saying "It'd be way harder for us to start out today."</p>
      <p>So what can people like you and I do?</p>
      <p><strong>Instead of focusing on <em>topics &amp; interests </em>we can focus on <em>people &amp; needs</em>.</strong> Here's what I mean: Gruber focused on writing about Apple. That's a topic. It'd definitely be hard to start a new Apple focused blog today, because the market's already saturated. People who are interested in that <em>topic</em> already have a lot of places to go.</p>
      <p>However, we can focus on a <em>particular group of people </em>(designers, developers, writers, IT managers) figure out <em>what they need</em> and then provide for that need in our blog posts, newsletters, and products. When I say they're "people in motion" I mean they're highly motivated to become better: they want to be <em>better </em>designers, developers, writers, and IT managers. If we can help them do that, they'll gladly join our audience.</p>
      <p>(Alex Hillman taught me about this; he calls it <em>communities of interest </em>vs <em>communities of practice</em>. <a href="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/videos/">You can watch the full video here</a>.)</p>
      <p>What do you think?</p>
      <p>Is it harder to build an audience now than it was? Have you struggled with this?</p>
