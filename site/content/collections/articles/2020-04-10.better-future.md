      That once a capitalist finds a machine that is efficient, it is in his or her interest to use that machine and to pay workers less. Or, if there is no machine, it's in the capitalist's interests to pit workers against one another to pay them as little as possible. Because if you own the Means of Production, the factory, you have something that workers don't have â€“ which is the Means of Production. So if you can pit workers against each other, and they will bid down and down to get the job, you come out ahead._
