    text: '<p><b>Update: </b>I''ve just written a more updated <a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/">"How to start a podcast" guide here</a>.</p><h2>First, choose your topic</h2><p>The most important step for a new podcaster isn''t buying the right gear,&nbsp;choosing the right platform, or even finding guests.</p><p><b>Before you do anything else, you need to pick a topic.</b></p><p>To do this, you''re going to answer two fundamental questions:</p><ol><li>Who is this podcast for?<br></li><li>What is it for?<br></li></ol><p>My show (<a href="https://saas.transistor.fm">Build your SaaS</a>) is for people starting a software business in 2018. It''s purpose is to share our journey, and help other founders navigate the startup stage.</p><h2>Next, do your research</h2><p>It''s not enough to pick a topic. To really stand out, you''ll need to ask yourself:</p><blockquote><p>What unique perspective can I bring to this subject? What hasn''t been done before? How can I stand out?</p></blockquote><p>A good tool for doing podcast research is <a href="https://chartable.com/">Chartable</a>.</p><p>You can use it to browse the different podcast categories, and see what types of shows are ranking highly.</p><p>When you see a show at the top of a category,&nbsp; look and see when it was last updated. If it''s been months (or years!) you might be able to create a new show to fill that space.</p>'
