      <p>What's the point of these acquisitions if they&nbsp;destroy the trust of users, alienate the founding team, and reduce the value of the business to nothing?*</p><p>For the past 5-10 years, the holy grail of building a startup was to get acquired. But with&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-big-idea-the-new-ma-playbook">70-90%&nbsp;of acquisitions failing</a>, maybe it's time for a new goal? Why not focus,&nbsp;<em>from the beginning</em>, on delivering value that people will pay for?</p><p>For example,&nbsp;Tumblr could have offered&nbsp;pro-users&nbsp;an advanced CMS for a monthly fee. Squarespace is the current leader in this space (in 2013 they reported profits of $38 million). Tumblr is easier to use than Squarespace, has a better mobile app, and has content distribution built-in.&nbsp;I think Tumblr could have been a veritable&nbsp;competitor.</p><p>While there's lots of innovation in <strong>technology</strong>, there's not much innovation in <strong>business models</strong>. There's only a few ways to make money: you can charge for your product, you can sell ads, or you can do a bit of both. If you can't make those economics work&nbsp;<em>on your own</em>, will an acquisition&nbsp;really change that?</p><p>One more thing: I still don't know what it's like to be a venture capitalist. I don't get "big numbers." However, my guess is that in the next 5 years, the money is going to have to go from&nbsp;<em>bored</em> to&nbsp;<em>smart</em>.</p><p>Cheers,<br>

      <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p><p>*&nbsp;Yes, a&nbsp;<em>few</em>&nbsp;(like Facebook buying Instagram) go well. But according to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-big-idea-the-new-ma-playbook">Harvard Business Review</a>, 70-90% fail.</p>
