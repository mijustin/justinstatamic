      <p>I've been thinking about this conversation I had with Jason Calacanis in 2013.</p>

      <p>Three years ago <a href="http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an">Yahoo announced they were acquiring Tumblr</a>. From the beginning, I was skeptical that it would work out.</p>
      <p><strong>To start, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/336522440769417216">users hated the idea</a>.</strong> They could sense that what they loved about Tumblr might get ruined. (One of my favorite quotes: "If our Tumblr founder needs money so badly why don’t we just have a kickstarter event to feed the founder?" :D)</p>
      <p>Second, it didn't seem to make sense from a business perspective:</p>
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en">
      <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kylefox">@kylefox</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover">@rrhoover</a> right now Tumblr is doing $25 mil in rev, and says it needs $100 mil to be profitable.</p>
      <p>Will Tumblr users accept 4x ads?</p>
      <p>&mdash; Justin Jackson (@mijustin) <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/335783024098672641">May 18, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
      <p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
      <p>Tumblr's culture (both users and the team) were very anti-advertising. Yahoo responded by saying:</p>
      <blockquote><p>When you hear us talk about native ads, where the ads are every bit as good as the content, and maybe even make the content better — that’s what we are aiming for.</p>
      <footer>- <cite>Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo</cite></footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That strategy didn't last long. Here are the three ads rotating on my Tumblr feed today:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-m-thumb wp-image-1311" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tumblr-ads-are-terrible-960x568.jpg" alt="Tumblr ads are terrible" width="960" height="568" /></p>
      <p>In fact, these are the only kinds of ads I see on Tumblr. What I mean is: these are the only three companies I see advertising there.</p>
      <p>Yahoo promised that Tumblr's ad revenue would hit $100 million in 2015. In last month's earning call they admitted <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/02/02/yahoo-writes-down-tumblrs-value-by-230-million/">they'd missed that mark</a> (although they wouldn't say by how much).</p>
      <h3>"We promise not to screw this up"</h3>
      <p>That now infamous line was in Marissa Mayer's <a href="http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an">acquisition announcement</a>. But now, things <em>are </em>screwed up. Like Geocities and Broadcast.com before it, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/02/as-tumblrs-value-heads-to-zero-a-look-at-where-it-ranks-among-yahoos-5-worst-acquisition-deals/">Tumblr's value is plummeting towards zero</a>.</p>
      <p>This whole situation makes me sad.</p>
      <p>I've been an active Tumblr user for years (and I still love it). I loved how David Karp brought a sense of whimsy to his product. I loved how the community was weird and creative.</p>
      <p>I've used Tumblr as a website host for my less-technical clients, and <a href="http://www.davetreadway.com/">they love it</a>. To this day, it's the most user friendly, mobile CMS I've seen.</p>
      <p>Why do I care so much?</p>
      <p>I guess I'm still asking the same question (both for Tumblr, and all founders):</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/335605020106059776</p>
      <p>What's the point of these acquisitions if they destroy the trust of users, alienate the founding team, and reduce the value of the business to nothing?<span style="color: #ff6600;">*</span></p>
      <p>For the past 5-10 years, the holy grail of building a startup was to get acquired. But with <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-big-idea-the-new-ma-playbook">70-90% of acquisitions failing</a>, maybe it's time for a new goal? Why not focus, <em>from the beginning</em>, on delivering value that people will pay for?</p>
      <p>For example, Tumblr could have offered pro-users an advanced CMS for a monthly fee. Squarespace is the current leader in this space (in 2013 they reported profits of $38 million). Tumblr is easier to use than Squarespace, has a better mobile app, and has content distribution built-in. I think Tumblr could have been a veritable competitor.</p>
      <p>While there's lots of innovation in <strong>technology</strong>, there's not much innovation in <strong>business models</strong>. There's only a few ways to make money: you can charge for your product, you can sell ads, or you can do a bit of both. If you can't make those economics work <em>on your own</em>, will an acquisition really change that?</p>
      <p>One more thing: I still don't know what it's like to be a venture capitalist. I don't get "big numbers." However, my guess is that in the next 5 years, the money is going to have to go from <em>bored</em> to <em>smart</em>.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />

      <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">*</span> Yes, a <em>few</em> (like Facebook buying Instagram) go well. But according to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-big-idea-the-new-ma-playbook">Harvard Business Review</a>, 70-90% fail.</p>
