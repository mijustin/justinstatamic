      <p>It's been almost 2 years since I built my standing desk at work. I built it with parts available from IKEA:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/90071168">VIKA AMON tabletop</a> - $49 (you could also use the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/50106773/">VIKA BYSKE tabletop</a>)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/84609085">VIKA BYSKE adjustable legs</a> - $20 x 4 (these go to a maximum height of 42 inches. I'm 5'8" and I keep mine at 41 inches)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/00101301">HUGO bar stool</a> - $119 (no longer available. The <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80203225/">GLENN bar stool</a> is similar <em>and </em>cheaper)</li>
      <li>From Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004E3CK4S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B004E3CK4S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justjackblog-20">Anti-fatigue mat</a> $25 (a rubber mat for standing on to reduce fatigue)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why I switched to a standing desk</h3>
      <p>I didn't switch to this setup because I wanted to stand all day; rather <strong>I wanted to avoid sitting all day.</strong>  With my standing desk, I can choose multiple working positions: standing, leaning, sitting, standing with one foot up, etc...  When you sit, you're limited to one posture; when you stand, you have more flexibility.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are health benefits to a standing desk: studies have shown that <a href="http://www.nursingschools.net/blog/2011/02/14-proven-side-effects-of-sitting-all-day/">sitting at a desk all day</a> causes a number of health problems, and that folks who use standing desks <a href="http://www.ergotron.com/tabid/754/language/en-CA/default.aspx">burn more calories</a>.</p>
      <h3>A review of my experience; 2 years after switching to a standing desk</h3>
      <p>It's been great, and I'm not going back. I genuinely have more energy with this set-up. I find I'm able to maintain my focus throughout a full workday.</p>
      <p><b>I also feel less stuck. </b>When I was sitting, I would continue sitting, even if I wasn't accomplishing anything productive. Now, if I find myself stagnating, I can step away and do something else: I go make a pot of coffee,  or do some stretches.</p>
      <p><strong>The VIKA BYSKE </strong>set-up is not for everyone. First: you'll have to be fairly short to use the legs (they have a max length of 42"). Second: the table can be quite wobbly if it's not anchored to the wall (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN5tGMXGGuY&amp;feature=youtu.be">see a video of me shaking my desk here</a>).</p>
      <h3>Why some people quit; and how you can avoid it</h3>
      <p>I know a lot of people that made the switch, but quit shortly after. <strong>If you're going to switch: be prepared for a transition period. </strong>There are 3 keys to success at the beginning:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Purchase an <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004E3CK4S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B004E3CK4S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justjackblog-20">anti-fatigue mat</a> and <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80203225/">a bar stool</a>. Don't skip this step!</li>
      <li>Take it easy: don't try to stand the whole day! Use the bar stool to sit and lean on, and give your legs a break.</li>
      <li>Raise your monitor off the desk. Again: I'm 5'8 tall. My desk is 42 1/4" high. I raise my monitors an additional 6-7 inches off my desk. <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2012/09/mf-standing-deskb_f.jpg">Here's a good diagram</a>.</li>
      </ol>
