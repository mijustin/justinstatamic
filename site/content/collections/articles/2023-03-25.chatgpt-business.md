    text: '<p>Lately, I''ve been getting more DMs from founders trying to launch new products built on top of ChatGPT.</p><p>They ask me for my advice, and honestly, I don''t know what to tell them.</p><p><strong>I''m not convinced that ChatGPT will be the platform on which a wave of new indie startups will be built.</strong></p><p><em>I''m not saying that tools like ChatGPT can''t be helpful assistants.</em></p><p>But it seems increasingly unlikely that new software products with "X powered by AI" as their main value prop will succeed long-term.</p><h2>Why ChatGPT is not a traditional platform</h2><p>Historically, bootstrapped startups have been built on top of open protocols (email, the web, RSS), open platforms (WordPress), and open-source (Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Vue, Tailwind CSS).</p><p>For indie founders, building on top of open protocols, using open-source tools, and distributing on open platforms gave them a chance to succeed.</p><p>For example, startups like MailChimp and ConvertKit could leverage email because nobody owns the protocol. They didn''t have to pay Gmail or Microsoft for "API access" or "postage fees."</p><p>And nearly every SaaS application leverages web browsers as their "platform" for launching their software product. Web applications don''t pay licensing fees for leveraging Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox.&nbsp;</p><p>Early bootstrapping successes (like 37signals) were able to launch profitable products like Basecamp by leveraging the open web. They built it with Ruby on Rails (open source), hosted it on the web, and got their message out by leveraging their blog. At the time, their main competitor was Microsoft Project. The open web enabled Basecamp (with only a few people on the project) to go head-to-head with a massive corporation and carve out a great business.</p><p>For decades, software startups built on the open web were more agile than their (larger) competition. They could move faster, leverage open source, and deploy new versions seamlessly to the web.</p><p>Building a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html?page=5">Web 2.0</a> app was largely democratized, but it gave a special leg up to smaller, bootstrapped companies. Usually, the only thing "cost of goods sold" was hosting. Most of the tech you built on top of was free, open-source, or open protocols.</p><p>Because anyone could leverage the open web to build a startup, indie founders had to differentiate by building simpler products, branding, and creative distribution channels.</p><p>These Web 2.0 startups would sometime build on top of a large centralized platform, often to their detriment. Developers who built on top of Twitter felt the bite of having their API access blocked. Apps sold on the Shopify app store saw their features incorporated into the Shopify product. <b>This became known as platform risk:</b> there''s always a risk that the platform will change its policies, algorithms, or features, which can negatively impact the startups built on it.</p><h3>The risks of building your startup on ChatGPT (or other AI platforms)</h3><p>Unlike the open protocols and open source bootstrappers have relied on in the past, OpenAI''s ChatGPT is not open. Their source code is closed, and you <a href="https://openai.com/pricing">must pay for API access</a>. OpenAI also just announced <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins">their plugin store</a>, a central marketplace they control.</p>'

AI software that writes your tweets and blog posts also seems popular.</p><p>Differentiation and acquisition for these products will be challenging (especially since every day, there seems to be a new competitor launching).</p><p><strong>But the biggest risk for ChatGPT-enabled apps is that existing products (Microsoft Office, Descript, Google Sheets, Zapier) are just implementing these features directly into their apps.</strong></p><p>It''s surprising how fast mature companies like Microsoft have been able to incorporate AI/ChatGPT as features in their existing apps.
