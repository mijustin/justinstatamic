    text: '<p>Lately, I''ve been getting more DMs from founders trying to launch new products built on top of ChatGPT.</p><p>They ask me for my advice, and honestly, I don''t know what to tell them.</p><p><strong>I''m not convinced that ChatGPT will be the platform on which a wave of new indie startups will be built.</strong></p><p><em>I''m not saying that tools like ChatGPT can''t be helpful assistants.</em></p><p>But it seems increasingly unlikely that new software products with "X powered by AI" as their main value prop will succeed long-term.</p><h2>Why ChatGPT is not a traditional platform</h2><p>Historically, bootstrapped startups have been built on top of open protocols (email, the web, RSS), open platforms (WordPress), and open-source (Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Vue, Tailwind CSS).</p><p>For indie founders, building on top of open protocols, using open-source tools, and distributing on open platforms gave them a chance to succeed.</p><p>For example, startups like MailChimp and ConvertKit could leverage email because nobody owns the protocol. They didn''t have to pay Gmail or Microsoft for "API access" or "postage fees."</p><p>And nearly every SaaS application leverages web browsers as their "platform" for launching their software product. Web applications don''t pay licensing fees for leveraging Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox.&nbsp;</p><p>Early bootstrapping successes (like 37signals) were able to launch profitable products like Basecamp by leveraging the open web. They built it with Ruby on Rails (open source), hosted it on the web, and got their message out by leveraging their blog. At the time, their main competitor was Microsoft Project. The open web enabled Basecamp (with only a few people on the project) to go head-to-head with a massive corporation and carve out a great business.</p><p><br></p><p>When you''re building on top of open protocols, using open-source as a tool, and distributing on open platforms, the differentiation is in the product.</p><p><strong>The first problem is that many of these new AI-driven products are similar.</strong>&nbsp;I''ve already seen many "AI-driven transcriptions for podcasts" products. AI software that writes your tweets and blog posts also seems popular.</p><p>Differentiation and acquisition for these products will be challenging (especially since every day, there seems to be a new competitor launching).</p><p><strong>But the biggest risk for ChatGPT-enabled apps is that existing products (Microsoft Office, Descript, Google Sheets, Zapier) are just implementing these features directly into their apps.</strong></p><p>It''s surprising how fast mature companies like Microsoft have been able to incorporate AI/ChatGPT as features in their existing apps. This greatly diminishes the need for intermediary products (often built by indie founders and bootstrappers).</p><p>This dynamic has become even more potent with the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI''s new plugin directory</a>:</p>'
