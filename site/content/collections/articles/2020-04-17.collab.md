    text: '<p>In the past couple of weeks, I''ve focused my writing on the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/fight-amazon">Fight Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/exposed">We''ve Been Exposed</a>). Last week I said:</p><blockquote><p>Our society ain''t right. And I don''t want to just complain about it, I want us to do something about it. What can we do to help tilt the playing field, so it''s fair for small businesses?</p></blockquote><p>The problem is that the cards are stacked against small businesses.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>This week, the stimulus package that was supposed to help small businesses in the USA <b>ran out of money</b>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/politics/coronavirus-small-business-program.html">The New York Times</a> reported that the stimulus didn''t reach the small businesses that needed it most (restaurants, bars, and hotels).&nbsp;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/14/coronavirus-law-congress-tax-change/">Washington Post</a> noted that "more than 80 percent of the benefits of a tax change tucked into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/senate-stimulus-bill-coronavirus-2-trillion-list-what-is-in-it/?tid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank">coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;will go to those who earn more than $1 million annually."</li><li>Meanwhile, megacorporations like Amazon are benefitting massively from society''s current quarantine. The value of Jeff Bezos'' wealth has increased by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic">$24 billion</a> since the beginning of the pandemic.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/amazon-coronavirus-public-utility-workers#maincontent"></a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/amazon-coronavirus-public-utility-workers#maincontent">From the Guardian</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The Covid-19 outbreak hasn’t slowed Amazon down. Quite the opposite: even as other businesses have downsized or shuttered, Amazon has proved remarkably well-placed to capitalise on these new circumstances, with customers spending a reported $11,000) a second on its products and services.</p></blockquote><p>Despite their surging sales, Amazon decided that now was a good time to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/amazon-slashes-commission-rates-for-affiliate-program.html">cut their affiliate rates</a>. Thousands of small businesses rely on Amazon commission checks for their livelihood. This affects folks like my friend Matt:</p>'

    text: '<p>Now we can see the danger of letting Amazon control all the distribution. Once they own the whole pie, "it is in their interest," as <a href="https://thisten.co/ltmam">Seth Godin</a> says, "to pay workers and small businesses less."</p><h2>How the system keeps us powerless</h2><p>Most Main Street businesses, solopreneurs, and bootstrappers follow the "American dream" philosophy. The idea is that we, as individuals, can build our own little silo and create our own wealth. It''s rugged individualism: each individual competes against each other, hoping to get a piece of the pie.</p><p>But it''s a lie.</p><p>We''re not competing for a piece of the pie, we''re fighting for the crumbs.</p><p>And it''s in the interest of the big platforms to keep this happening. Again, Seth Godin:</p><blockquote><p>If you own the factory, you have something that workers don''t have – which is the Means of Production. So if you can pit workers against each other, and they will bid down and down to get the job, you come out ahead.</p></blockquote><p>But these days, it''s not so much owning the factory that gives you power; it''s owning the Means of Distribution. This is Amazon''s big strength. They have the:</p><ul><li><b>physical distribution:</b>&nbsp;their warehouses, distribution centers, and logistics,</li><li><b>software platform:</b>&nbsp;their storefront, cloud architecture, search engine, and traffic.</li></ul><p>Since 1994, Amazon has invested billions of investor money (and most of its profits) into creating the world''s largest marketplace.</p><p>And it''s not just a "big marketplace;" it''s a behemoth.&nbsp;</p>'
