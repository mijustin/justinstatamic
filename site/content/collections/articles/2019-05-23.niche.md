    text: '<p>There''s an old internet myth that goes like this:</p><ul><li>The web is big and has billions of users.</li><li>Because the web is so big, even small niches have thousands of members.</li><li>Therefore, you can target almost any niche and make money on the internet.</li></ul><p>It''s probably best exemplified in this old Merlin Mann quote from SXSW in 2009:</p><blockquote><p>"Don’t have a blog about Star Wars, have a blog about Jawas. In fact, have a blog about that one Jawa who is only the scene for a minute. It’s going to be so much easier for you to dominate."</p></blockquote><p>There is some wisdom in this. If you don''t know who you''re serving, it''s going to be difficult to position yourself.</p>'
