    text: '<p>There''s an old internet myth that goes like this:</p><ul><li>The web is big and has billions of users.</li><li>Because the web is so big, even small niches have thousands of members.</li><li>Therefore, you can target almost any niche and make money on the internet.</li></ul><p>It''s probably best exemplified in this old Merlin Mann quote from SXSW in 2009:</p><blockquote><p>"Don’t have a blog about Star Wars, have a blog about Jawas. In fact, have a blog about that one Jawa who is only the scene for a minute. It’s going to be so much easier for you to dominate."</p></blockquote><p>There is some wisdom in this. If you don''t have a specific target in mind, it''s difficult to build a unique position in the market.</p><p>But the idea that "the internet is big, and therefore, any niche will do" isn''t true. Picking a good market is more nuanced than that.</p><h2>1,000 true fans?</h2><p>In 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote a <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">groundbreaking essay</a> that made a bold promise:</p><blockquote><p>To be a successful creator, you don’t need millions. You need only thousands of true fans.</p></blockquote><p>Kelly''s spearheaded the idea that the internet makes almost any niche viable:</p>'

    text: '"As far as I can tell, there is nothing — no product, no idea, no desire — without a fan base on the internet. Every thing made can interest at least one person in a million. Yet if even only one out of million people were interested, that’s potentially 7,000 people on the planet. That means that any 1-in-a-million appeal can find 1,000 true fans."'

    text: '<p>It''s a theory that''s full of optimism: "Every thing made can interest at least one person in a million — it’s a low bar."</p><p>His math works out in the sense that 1,000 people x $100 year = $100,000 (which for most people is a pretty good salary).</p><p>But in practice, the math is more complicated. Kevin Kelly later concedes:</p><blockquote><p>"The trick is to practically find those fans, or more accurately, to have them find you."</p></blockquote><p>Yes! And finding, pitching, and convincing folks to buy your product is harder than it seems!</p><p>Even on the internet, your fans will need to congregate in a group online that''s easy to access. If there''s no common meeting place, it will cost you too much time and money to find them. These prospects will also need to have the ability and conviction to pay you.</p><p>Plus, to earn revenue from a fan, they''ll need to like what you have to offer.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With that in mind, it''s clear: 7,000 potential customers isn''t enough for most bootstrapped businesses.</p><p>You''re going to need a bigger pool of prospects.</p><h2>How big of a market do you need to bootstrap a successful software business?</h2><p>I''ve observed hundreds of independent entrepreneurs, at MicroConf, in <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a>, and my role as an advisor.</p><p>There are exceptions but almost everyone who is consistently earning more than $10k / month (and certainly those who break $50k) targeted a large, or fast-growing, market that they could reach efficiently.</p><p>How large does it need to be? Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>There are over 5 million PHP developers in the world, so when Taylor Otwell launched <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/">Forge</a>, he got 1,000 customers within a month.</li><li>There are over 500,000 Shopify stores, so when Björn started making <a href="https://www.forsbergplustwo.com/">Shopify apps</a>, he had a big pool of potential customers. Within six years, he was earning $275,000 in annual revenue.</li><li>When Ruben Gamez saw that DocuSign had over 200 million users, he thought: "That''s a big market." And so he launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docsketch.com/">Docsketch</a>.</li></ul><p>Don''t start by asking: "what''s the smallest market I could serve?"</p><p>Instead, look at the&nbsp;<b>total addressable market</b>, and plan on capturing a small percentage of that.</p>'

      **Justin:** Did starting the company turn out the way you thought?
      
      **Harry:** I thought it would be a few weeks and we'd be raking in the dough. And it turns out it was more like years... (laughs)
      
      **Justin:** So, how many years were you guys both working on this before you'd made even any sensible money?
      
      **Ted:** I'm not sure what you mean by "sensible." (laughs)
      
      **Justin:** Like, enough to live off; enough to cover both of your living costs.
      
      **Ted:** Well, it took a while before we were paying ourselves even a reasonable salary. Because for the first year and a half, we paid ourselves nothing. Then at about a year and a half, that's when we actually hired a couple employees. So at that point, we started paying ourselves a salary, but it was very minimal.

      **Justin:** So if you could do it again, would you start the same company? 
      
      **Ted:** Probably not. (Laughs) Because it's just been a very long, slow grind. One of the reasons this market is available to us is because it's difficult.
      
      You read about all these other startups we could be doing: something that targets a larger market. There, you can do the same amount of work, but get twice as many customers or ten times as many customers. 
      
      Because our product is complex, and people aren't just searching the web for it, sales is more difficult, the marketing is more difficult, support is more difficult.

      80% of fish are caught by 20% of fishermen. How do they do this? _They fish where the fish are most often._ It is this ability to more accurately forecast where fish are likely to be, that separates the successful fisher from the fishless. 
      
      We had a motto in my tackle shop: "We don't sell fishing tackle, we sell dreams. The dream of more or bigger fish."
      
      For many customers catching more or bigger fish was too lofty an aim. They merely wanted to catch some fish.
      
      Many of these 'fishless' customers had all the right gear, so this was not their problem.
      
      **Too often unsuccessful fishermen use this nice piece of fractured logic:** 
      All fish live in water, thus all water has fish in it. Therefore anywhere you fish in water, there is a chance of catching fish.
      
      Their problem was not how to fish, **but where to fish**.
