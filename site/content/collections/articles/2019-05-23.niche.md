    text: '<p>There''s an old internet myth that goes like this:</p><ul><li>The web is big and has billions of users.</li><li>Because the web is so big, even small niches have thousands of members.</li><li>Therefore, you can target almost any niche and make money on the internet.</li></ul><p>It''s probably best exemplified in this old Merlin Mann quote from SXSW in 2009:</p><blockquote><p>"Don’t have a blog about Star Wars, have a blog about Jawas. In fact, have a blog about that one Jawa who is only the scene for a minute. It’s going to be so much easier for you to dominate."</p></blockquote><p>There is some wisdom in this. If you don''t have a specific group of people in mind, it''s difficult to build a unique position in the market.</p><p>This is something Al Ries identified in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/746122">Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</a>. In an overcrowded market, you need to stand out somehow:</p><blockquote><p>"In the communication jungle out there, the only hope to score big is to be selective, to concentrate on narrow targets, to practice segmentation. In a word, ''positioning.''"</p></blockquote><h2>How big of a market do you need to bootstrap a successful software business?</h2><p>I''ve observed hundreds of independent entrepreneurs, at MicroConf, in MegaMaker, and in my role as an advisor.</p><p>There are exceptions but almost everyone who is consistently earning more than $10k / month (and certainly those that break $50k) targeted a large, or fast-growing, market that they could reach efficiently.</p><p>How large does it need to be? Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>There are over 5 million PHP developers in the world, so when Taylor Otwell launched <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/">Forge</a> he got 1,000 customers within a month.</li><li>There are over 500,000 Shopify stores, so when Björn started making <a href="https://www.forsbergplustwo.com/">Shopify apps</a>, he had a big pool of potential customers. Within 6 years, he was earning $275,000 in annual revenue.</li><li>When Ruben Gamez saw that DocuSign had over 200 million users, he thought: "That''s a big market." And so he launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docsketch.com/">Docsketch</a>.</li></ul><p>Seth Godin thinks we should ask:</p><blockquote><p>"What’s the minimum number of people you would need to influence to make it worth the effort?"</p></blockquote><p>But, I think you still need to look at the broader picture: what is the <b>total</b> addressable market?</p><p>Because we''re likely not going to be able to influence 100%, 50%, or even 25% of a given market.</p><p>Typically, we start our funnels at "number of visitors" but in reality, the funnel looks like this:&nbsp;</p>'
