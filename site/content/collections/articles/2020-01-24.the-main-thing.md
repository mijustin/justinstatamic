      <p>At a restaurant, almost everyone orders the entree.
      Some folks order appetizers and even fewer will order dessert.&nbsp;</p>

    text: '<p>Every market has a “main product” that sucks up most of the value in a category.</p><h2>The indie software market</h2><p>If you''re hoping to build an independent software business, I think it''s best to focus on your category''s main dish (as opposed to a side-dish).</p><h3>Case study: Upscribe</h3><p>For example, my friend Josh Anderton built a tool called <a href="https://upscri.be/">Upscribe</a>, which offered "newsletter subscribe forms for Medium." Finding that too narrow of a focus, he eventually expanded by offering general-purpose embeddable forms. You could hook these forms up to MailChimp or ConvertKit.</p>'

    text: '<p>The problem? His service wasn''t the main dish. In his category, email newsletters, having a fancy embeddable form is ancillary to the main thing: creating and sending the emails.</p><p>He''s recently pivoted. Now, in addition to beautiful forms, you can create and send email newsletters from Upscribe. Instead of offering a "nice-to-have" application, Josh is moving Upscribe into the "must-have" category.</p><h3>Exceptions to the rule</h3><p>In some product categories (email inbox), the “main thing” is so big (Gmail), that you can build an ancillary add-on and do well. The <a href="https://connect.clearbit.com/">Clearbit</a> add-on for Gmail proves this.</p><p>Steve Jobs infamously <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drew-houston-dropbox-steve-jobs-2017-6">lambasted Dropbox</a> for being a "feature, not a product:"</p><blockquote><p>"Steve started trolling us a little bit, saying we''re a feature, not a product, and telling us a bunch of things like that we don''t control an operating system so we''re going to be disadvantaged." – Drew Houston, founder of Dropbox</p></blockquote><p>However, the file-synchronization market turned out to be huge (Dropbox reportedly had more than 500 million users in 2016). It''s the size and momentum of a given category will determine whether an add-on product can be profitable.&nbsp;</p><p>Other examples of big categories that have room for ancillary products:</p><ul><li><b>E-commerce</b> – this category is so big you can build a great business (like <a href="https://carthook.com/">Carthook</a>) even if you''re not providing the main thing (Shopify).</li><li><b>Mac / PC utilities</b> – if you''re one of the <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-PC-exist-in-the-world">2 billion people</a> using a personal computer, you''ll likely need to buy additional utilities from time to time. These add-ons supplement the operating system.</li><li><b>Audio, video, image editing</b> – these markets are large on their own, but are also predisposed towards plugins. If you''re editing in Adobe Creative Suite (<a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/10/28/oops-adobe-leaves-7-5-million-creative-cloud-accounts-exposed/">15 million users</a>), buying some additional <a href="https://www.grutbrushes.com/">brushes or textures</a> makes sense.</li></ul><p>But in many categories, the market’s just not big enough to create that level of demand. Everyone orders the entree, but not enough people order dessert.</p><h2>Mapping the value chain</h2><p>Nathan Baschez, of Divinations, recommends <a href="https://divinations.substack.com/p/the-value-chain-is-the-dna-of-business">mapping the value chain</a> of your particular category. You outline all of the steps from creation to consumption.&nbsp;</p><p>Here''s an example I made for the email newsletter category:</p>'

    text: '<p>The value map is divided into three categories: pre-creation, creation, and consumption.</p><h3>Pre-creation</h3><p>There''s a bunch of stuff that needs to happen before you create an email newsletter:</p><ul><li>To attract subscribers, you''ll need content (<a href="/articles">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">Tweets</a>, <a href="https://saas.transistor.fm">podcast</a>)</li><li>You''ll also need subscription forms (so people can enter their email)</li><li>And you''ll need a secure place to store all of those subscribers'' email addresses</li></ul><h3>Creation</h3><p>Once you have subscribers, you can write and send your email newsletter. This is the where you''re using a tool like ConvertKit, MailChimp, or Upscribe.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, once you click "send" your emails have to go through a bunch more infrastructure (ISPs, operating systems) before it reaches the recipient.</p><h3>Consumption</h3><p>Eventually, your email lands in a recipient''s email inbox on one of their devices (PC, tablet, or phone) and they''re able to read it.</p><h2>How can you be sure that you''re offering "the main thing?"</h2><p>Looking at the above example, we can evaluate a product category for opportunities. We can see which stages of the value chain:</p><ul><li>are B2C vs B2B,</li><li>better for bootstrappers,</li><li>get most of the subscription revenue.</li></ul><p>Generally, you want to target the part of the "creation" activity where people are currently spending the most money.&nbsp;</p><p>It''s interesting to observe which parts of the chain our society values and devalues. For example, in the website market, the software that allows you to do the writing, editing and publishing (WordPress) is worth nothing. People don''t pay for the CMS, they pay for the hosting.</p><p>Nathan and I discussed this in more detail here:</p>'
