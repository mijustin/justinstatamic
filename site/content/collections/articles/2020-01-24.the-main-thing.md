    text: '<p>Every market has a “main product,” as well as items that are ancillary to that main thing. And, unless the main market is huge, it’s hard to make a business from the ancillary market.</p><h2>The indie software market</h2><p>If you''re hoping to build an independent software business, I think it''s best to focus on your category''s main dish (as opposed to a side-dish).</p><h3>Case study: Upscribe</h3><p>For example, my friend Josh Anderton built a tool called <a href="https://upscri.be/">Upscribe</a>, which offered "newsletter subscribe forms for Medium." Finding that too narrow of a focus, he eventually expanded by offering general-purpose embeddable forms. You could hook these forms up to MailChimp or ConvertKit.</p>'

      <p>The problem? His service wasn't a main dish.&nbsp;</p><p>In some product categories (email), the “main thing” is so big (Gmail), that you can build an ancillary add-on (Clearbit) and do well.
      
      But in many categories, the market’s just not big enough to create that level of demand. Everyone orders the entree, but nobody orders dessert.</p>
