    text: '<p>I''ve been writing on justinjackson.ca&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208000149/http://justinjackson.ca/hello-world/">since 2008</a>. For 10 years it''s been on WordPress.</p><p>But, in the last year, I''ve been looking to switch to a different CMS.</p><p>I had three main objectives for the move:</p><p></p><ol><li>Make my&nbsp;blog posts easier to backup and retrieve.<br></li><li>Make my website faster.</li><li>Decrease my hosting costs.</li></ol><p>For example, by saving my&nbsp;blog posts as text files, or even static HTML, it makes them easier to backup. I can save copies locally, in Dropbox, and on GitHub. You can''t do that (easily) with a WordPress database.<br></p><p>This is going to sound morbid, but I think a lot of us think about this question:</p><blockquote>What''s going to happen to my website when I die?</blockquote><p>At the very least my family might want a backup of my writing. And, I don''t want to leave my family a letter that says: "Upon my death, please use&nbsp;phpMyAdmin to view my post data."</p><p>The other advantage of switching from WordPress&nbsp;is speed. A site that doesn''t need to query a database can, generally, load content a lot faster.</p><p>Related, if you have a high-traffic website, hosting on WordPress can be expensive. Since 2012, this site has cost me&nbsp;$8567 to host (an average of $116 per month). Basically, if you want performance, security, and stability on WordPress, it''s going to cost you.</p><p>My friends Paul Jarvis and Jarrod Drysdale recently switched away from managed hosting to Digital Ocean. Paul figures he''s saving ~$3,000 a year.</p>'

    text: '<p>To summarize, switching from a database-driven CMS should make my site faster and cheaper to host. The other big benefit is my content will be easier to save and retrieve for the future.</p><h3>Evaluating my options</h3><p>Broadly, there are two types of content management systems that don''t rely on a database:</p><ol><li>Static site generators<br></li><li>Flat-file CMSes</li></ol><h4>Static site generators</h4><p>Tools like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://wp2static.com/">WP2Static</a>, and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> will generate static HTML files from your content. These files can be uploaded to any server.</p><p>The big downside is that tools like Jekyll are command-line driven. You also have to render and deploy everything at once, which can slow down updates.</p><h4>Flat-file CMSes</h4><p>CMSes like <a href="https://statamic.com/">Statamic</a>, <a href="https://www.pulsecms.com/">PulseCMS</a>, and <a href="https://getkirby.com/">Kirby</a>&nbsp;store your content in text-files (usually markdown based). They don''t need a database to render content.</p><p>They also feature a web-based interface. You''ll get an admin panel, WYSIWYG editor, and the ability to easily add blog posts.</p><h3>Why I went with Statamic</h3><p>One of my objectives this year is to learn more programming.</p><p>A few years ago, Adam Wathan introduced me to Taylor Otwell. He''d created a "Rails-like" framework for PHP called Laravel.</p><p>Taylor asked me to speak at Laracon 2016 in NYC. I was blown away. All the devs there were passionate, excited to make stuff, and welcoming.</p>'
