    text: '<h2>How I got into public speaking</h2><p>When I was younger, I was the shyest kid in my whole class.</p><p>I went to a French immersion school (that''s a thing in Canada), and every year we''d have "Concours <g class="gr_ gr_36 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="36" data-gr-id="36">d‚Äôart</g> <g class="gr_ gr_37 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="37" data-gr-id="37">oratoire</g>." It was a public-speaking competition for students across the province.&nbsp;</p><p>"Concours" was mandatory, and I despised it. I''d have anxiety for weeks beforehand. When my turn came, I''d grit my teeth and just get through it as fast as possible (while staring at my shoes).</p><p>Fast forward to adulthood.</p><p>When I started my career, I realized that learning to speak publicly would be a critical skill. Whether it was presenting to my dev team, giving a product demo, or speaking at a local meetup, I needed to know how to give a talk.</p><p>I started small by doing team presentations. Then, I moved on to giving product demos.</p><p>Eventually, I put on a small workshop for our customers.</p><p>In 2011, I attended a Future of Web Apps conference in Miami and wondered, "could I speak on stage at a tech conference like this?"</p><p>I kept practicing. I spoke at local meetups and events.</p><p>And then, in 2015 I submitted an attendee talk for MicroConf in Las Vegas. My topic was picked, and I gave my 12-minute talk on stage at a tech conference!</p><p>The organizers liked it so much, they asked me to be the keynote speaker at MicroConf in Barcelona that summer.</p>'

"Anytime I start to go into a panic attack, I just lay back and breathe."</li><li><b>Start small: </b>Jason''s first talk was 30-45 seconds at a Rails Conf. "During the lightning talks, they were having technical problems," he explains, "so&nbsp;they asked if anyone had a lightning talk they wanted to give that didn‚Äôt involve a computer." Jason was scared, but he went up and gave a short, honest talk: "Hi, I''m Jason, and I struggle with anxiety." It was short, but afterward, he realized that <b>he''d done it</b>.</li></ul>'
