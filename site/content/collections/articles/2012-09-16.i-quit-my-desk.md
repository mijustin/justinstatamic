      <p>Here are things I'm trying to quit doing at my desk:</p><ol><li><strong>Thinking: </strong>Nobody does their best thinking sitting at their desk. When you reflect on your biggest "Ah-Ha!" moments, how many of them occurred while you were staring at a screen? If you're like me, your best thinking happens when you're not at your desk: taking a walk, going and asking another person for help, drinking a coffee, in the shower. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/228306655283122176">Your desk is for executing; do your thinking elsewhere</a>.<br>
      </strong></li><li><strong>Socializing: </strong>When I sit down at my desk, I want to be in work mode. I want to prioritize my most important tasks, and then complete them with the fastest velocity possible. Socializing while I'm at my desk sullies the purity of the <em>workstation.</em> This is why the water cooler is actually a brilliant social construct: when you want to hang out, you can get up from your <em>workstation </em>and go to the <em>socialstation. </em>I think every office should have a <em>socialstation</em>, a place (or time in the morning) where team members can hang out, and talk informally.</li><li><strong>Procrastinating: </strong>Check Facebook, check Twitter, go on YouTube, check email, mindlessly read blog posts. <strong>I think that breaks, and downtime, are important in a work day.</strong><strong> </strong>But again: I think maintaing the purity of my desk as a place where I work is important. If I need some "mindless" time, I think it's better to walk away from my desk and have a place and time limit where I do that. It's also important that we catch ourselves when procrastinating and ask ourselves: "Why?" Are we procrastinating because we're tired? Hungry? Bored? Are we stuck on a problem? Are we just feeling lethargic and need to get up and move around? Figure out what's at the source of your mindless net browsing, and deal with the problem.</li><li><strong>Sitting: </strong>for the past 18 months I've been using a standing desk. I've realized that the best part isn't that I'm standing all day; <strong>it's that I'm not sitting</strong>. A standing desk allows you to stand, sit, lean, and put one leg up while you're at your workstation. Even better, I've felt more freedom to <em>just walk away </em>when I'm faced with a problem and need to do some thinking (or when I'm tired and need a break).</li></ol><p>Many writers maintain a <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/famous-small-offthegrid-worksp-140587">private writing hut</a>. The hut has one purpose: it's the place they go to write. They don't do anything else there. Once they can't write any more, they go do something else. I think we need to think of our desks in the same way: these are places where we get work done.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>Cheers,<br>
