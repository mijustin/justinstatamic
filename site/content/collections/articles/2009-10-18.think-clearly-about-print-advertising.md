    text: '<p><em>Note: I originally posted this on <a href="http://strongcaster.com">strongcaster.com</a>, but I thought I would post it here as well, with a few modifications</em></p><p>Derek Sivers has <a href="http://sivers.org/1pct">a great story on his blog</a> about a musician who booked an ad in a magazine hoping to convert 1% of the magazine’s readership into sales.&nbsp; In this case, 1% would have translated into 10,000 CDs sold.&nbsp; <strong>The result?&nbsp; 4 CDs sold.</strong></p><p>He ends with this line: <strong>“He forgot there was a number lower than one percent.”</strong></p><p>This story reminded me of when I owned my retail shop.&nbsp; We would place a full-page ad in the newspaper (with a coupon), hoping sales would pour in.&nbsp; The newspaper’s circulation was 20,000, so a 1% conversion would have meant 200 new customers.&nbsp; <strong>But sure enough, only a handful of new people would walk through the door.</strong></p><p><strong>Circulation means nothing without engagement. </strong> This is one of the reasons the newspaper industry is in such trouble; for years, businesses would throw money at advertising and hope it would make a difference.&nbsp; The problem is that, often, it didn’t.</p><p>This isn’t to say that <strong>print doesn’t have a place</strong>; there are many factors to consider, including the size of one’s target market, ad design, etc…&nbsp; <strong>The difference is that online you can measure engagement: </strong></p><ul><li>with a well-built website, you can track visitors, and what they''re reading when they are on your site</li><li>a social marketing campaign can be measured for success based on blog posts on other sites, comments, tweets, etc.</li><li>an email newsletter can provide you with stats based on interests and click-throughs.</li></ul><p>I recommend that businesses with yearly marketing budgets of $500-$5,000 spend most of that money building engagement <strong>online</strong>.&nbsp; When you compare it with print advertising, you will get a much better return on investment. </p>'
