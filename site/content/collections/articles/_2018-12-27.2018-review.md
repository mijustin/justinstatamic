    text: '<p>Life doesn''t always move forward in a straight line.</p><p>Previously, in 2017, I had an incredibly difficult year. It culminated in a brutal depression. It laid me out.</p><p>For nine months, I wasn''t able to work more than a few hours a day.</p><p>I earn most of my income from my&nbsp;<a href="https://join.megamaker.co/">books and video tutorials</a>. To make that business work you need to create a new course every year. A big portion of a course creator''s income comes from their new material. But I wasn''t able to make anything new.</p><p>With no new money coming in, I had to use my savings to pay my family''s living expenses.</p><p>I slept a lot. I lost a bunch of weight.&nbsp;</p><p>It felt like everything in my life was breaking down.</p><p><b>And then I found a therapist.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Therapy is mental medicine. Instead of fighting your demons by yourself, you''ve got a trained professional in your corner. Every time I think: "I must be the only one that''s experienced this," my therapist shakes her head and says: "Justin, you''re not alone in this. I see this all the time. Other people have overcome this. You can too."</p><p>I''m happy to say, my mental health improved a ton this year. And that''s good. üëç</p>'

    text: '<p>But climbing out of depression is like emerging from a shelter after a hurricane. I''d survived, but when I surveyed the landscape, there was a lot of collateral damage. The struggle takes a huge toll on your life, even after you "get better."</p><p>This past year, I''ve tried to speak honestly about what it''s really like to&nbsp;<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/bootstrap">bootstrap a business</a>. I''ve also been transparent about my&nbsp;<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/mentalhealth">mental health</a>.</p><p>Most of what we share publicly is sanitized. That''s fine, but it can create a false perception that life is easier for others than it really is.</p><p>I want to be truthful about the good and the bad.</p><p>This was a hard year-in-review to write because I didn''t feel like I was really "winning" in 2018. It felt like a struggle.</p><p>One perspective that helped was&nbsp;<a href="https://fs.blog/annie-duke/">this interview</a>&nbsp;with Annie Duke, a professional poker player:</p><blockquote><p>The thing that gets in the way of most learning is "the pain." It''s this double edged sword. You need the pain, but <b>it does not feel good to lose.&nbsp;</b>We view it as an attack on our identity.</p></blockquote><p>Humans want to be perceived as successful; especially entrepreneurs!</p><p>We don''t want to lose. We want to win, constantly, all the time.<br></p><p>But, as Annie Duke explains, sometimes you need to experience pain in the short term, so you can win in the long-term.<br></p><p>She continues:</p><blockquote><p>We have to be able to say: "Okay, <i>I''m willing to take this short term pain, because I know in the long run it''s going to help me learn</i>. I''m going to examine my decisions. I''m going to see where I could have made better decisions that would have increased the likelihood that I had a better outcome. I''m going to take the short term hit (this feeling that doesn''t feel very good). But, in the long run I''m going feel better about myself."</p></blockquote><p>If we''re optimizing for learning, our charts can''t always go "up and to the right."</p><p>For me personally, this meant that my revenue didn''t grow this year.&nbsp;</p><p>My final audited numbers aren''t in, but I figure my solo business made about $140,000 in 2018.<br></p>'

(More on that below)</p><p>With a $140,000 in gross revenue, I''m guessing I paid myself about $90,000. That''d be more than enough if I was single, but with a family of six, it''s not enough. (<a href="https://www.epi.org/resources/budget/">Reference</a>)</p><p>So, financially, I''m disappointed with 2018''s results.</p><p>But on the other hand, I''m incredibly thankful. Hundreds of customers bought something I''d made, and helped me pay most of my bills.</p><p>Also, because I had independent income coming in, I had the freedom to invest my time into <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, which is an asset that I think will be worth much more in the future.</p><h2>What I learned in 2018</h2><ul><li>I learned about&nbsp;<a href="https://profitfirstbook.com/">Profit First</a>, which <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/solorisk">I''ve started implementing</a>.</li><li>It''s important to <a href="https://twitter.com/delk/status/999091010406764544">have hard conversations</a> early-on in any process (like a co-founder relationship).</li><li>Knowing even a <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1004867888283410433">bit of programming</a> is incredibly empowering.</li></ul><h2>What went well in 2018</h2><h3>Launching Transistor.fm</h3><p>Partnering with my friend <a href="https://jonbuda.com/">Jon Buda</a>, and working on <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a> together, was the best thing I did professionally this year.</p><p>For years, I''ve worked on projects by myself. In the past I''ve hired contractors, and have done the occasional short-lived partnership, but working with Jon is different.</p>'
