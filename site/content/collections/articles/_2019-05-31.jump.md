    text: '<blockquote><p>"Will someone pay for this?"</p></blockquote><p>For bootstrappers, this is the question we pose when we''re about to build something new. And it''s a good place to start! But it doesn''t go deep enough.</p><p><b>We''re not looking for "someone," or even "some people."</b> In most cases, we''re looking for hundreds or thousands of customers. Getting five customers immediately after launch is a good sign, but if you can''t grow beyond that you won''t be able to build a sustainable business.</p><p><b>Likewise, we want people to be willing to pay now.</b>&nbsp;We''re not looking for someone to pay "eventually." For a SaaS to work, it needs a group of people who are highly motivated to start a subscription <i>now</i>&nbsp;and then keep paying every month. Netflix doesn''t want you to become a customer next year, they want you as a customer now.</p><p><b>And finally, we want to attract customers without expending too much effort.</b>&nbsp;If can''t take too much time, money, and energy, to convince someone to pay.</p><h2>Fishing for business</h2><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche">The Myth of the Niche Market</a>, I used fishing as a metaphor for choosing the right market.</p><p>I quoted professional angler <a href="http://www.bishfish.co.nz/articles/salt/flogic.htm">Tony Bishop</a> who said:<br></p><blockquote><p>80% of fish are caught by 20% of fishermen. How do they do this? <i>They fish where the fish are most often.</i></p></blockquote><p>I''d like to emphasize that second part: "fish where the fish are most often."</p><p>Tony''s advice can be broken down into these parts:</p><ol><li>Decide which fish you want to catch</li><li>Figure out where those fish hang out ("For inshore species look for reefs, foul ground, weed beds, with good tidal or current flows")</li><li>Give the fish something they want</li></ol><p>He spends most of <a href="http://www.bishfish.co.nz/articles/salt/flogic.htm">this essay</a> describing steps for determining where to find groups of fish:</p><blockquote><p>Find the optimum environment, for the target species, and you will find the largest numbers of fish and the biggest fish.</p></blockquote><p>Again, fishing cliches seem to match business cliches: "right time, right place, right bait."</p><h3>It''s about showing up in the right spot</h3><p>There''s a viral video that shows a boat motoring down a river. Suddenly, hundreds of fish start jumping around, and into, the boat.</p>'

    text: '<p>To me, this is what a good product-market fit feels like.&nbsp;<b>Without you having to try too hard, customers should be showing up to buy your product.</b></p><p>In the future, you''ll use sales and marketing techniques, but initially, you want to see some unprompted momentum.</p><p>People are surprised when my friend <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/adam-wathan-launch">Adam Wathan</a> tells them how he got his first customers:</p><blockquote><p>"I had 14 sales on the night before I officially launched."</p></blockquote><p>When people figure out how to buy before you''ve told them how to buy, that''s a really good sign.</p><h2>A framework</h2><p>What do we want? We want customers that are:</p><ul><li>Plentiful in number</li><li>Willing to pay now</li><li>So motivated that we don''t have to work too hard to convince them</li></ul><p>So if we have an idea</p><p>Customer research</p><p>Pre-sales</p><p><b>Evaluating momentum</b></p>'
