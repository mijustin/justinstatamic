    text: '<blockquote><p>"Will someone pay for this?"</p></blockquote><p>For bootstrappers, this is the question we pose when we''re about to build something new. And it''s a good place to start! But it doesn''t go deep enough.</p><p><b>We''re not looking for "someone," or even "some people."</b> In most cases, we''re looking for hundreds or thousands of customers. Getting five customers immediately after launch is a good sign, but if you can''t grow beyond that you won''t be able to build a sustainable business.</p><p><b>Likewise, we want people to be willing to pay now.</b>&nbsp;We''re not looking for someone to pay "eventually." For a SaaS to work, it needs a group of people who are highly motivated to start a subscription <i>now</i>&nbsp;and then keep paying every month. Netflix doesn''t want you to become a customer next year, they want you as a customer now.</p><p><b>And finally, we want to attract customers without expending too much effort.</b>&nbsp;If can''t take too much time, money, and energy, to convince someone to pay.</p><h2>Fishing for business</h2><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche">The Myth of the Niche Market</a>, I used fishing as a metaphor for choosing the right market.</p><p>I quoted professional angler <a href="http://www.bishfish.co.nz/articles/salt/flogic.htm">Tony Bishop</a> who said:<br></p><blockquote><p>80% of fish are caught by 20% of fishermen. How do they do this? They fish where the fish are most often.</p></blockquote><p>It''s a good analogy for thinking about which markets to target (ones with lots of fish).</p><p>But it leaves an important question: how do we know we''re in a good market, with a product that many people will pay for, where sales don''t require an oversized effort?</p><p>Let''s answer that question with a different fishing metaphor.</p><p>I grew up watching Sesame Street. My favorite sketch was <a href="https://youtu.be/cUusX1Js6R0">Ernie and Bert in a fishing boat</a>.&nbsp;</p>'

    text: '<p>Bert is trying to catch fish with his rod but isn''t have any luck.</p><p>Ernie claims that he can catch some fish easily. When Bert offers him his rod, Ernie pushes it aside: "Oh, I don''t need a fishing pole, Bert," he replies "you see, I call them. I have this special fish call. And they come right into the boat."</p><p>Bert thinks this is hilarious; he doesn''t believe Ernie and urges him to show him.</p><p>Ernie clears his throat and yells:<br></p><blockquote><p>Here, fishy, fishy, fishy!</p></blockquote><p>And a fish jumps into the boat.</p>'
