    text: '<blockquote><p>"Will someone pay for this?"</p></blockquote><p>For bootstrappers, this is the question we pose when we''re about to build something new. And it''s a good place to start! But it doesn''t go deep enough.</p><p><b>We''re not looking for "someone," or even "some people."</b> In most cases, we''re looking for hundreds or thousands of customers. Getting five customers immediately after launch is a good sign, but if you can''t grow beyond that you won''t be able to build a sustainable business.</p><p><b>Likewise, we want people to be willing to pay now.</b>&nbsp;We''re not looking for someone to pay "eventually." For a SaaS to work, it needs a group of people who are highly motivated to start a subscription <i>now</i>&nbsp;and then keep paying every month. Netflix doesn''t want you to become a customer next year, they want you as a customer now.</p><p><b>And finally, we want to attract customers without expending too much effort.</b>&nbsp;If can''t take too much effort and expense to convince someone to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an idea I introduced in <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche">The Myth of the Niche Market</a>, that I''d like to sharpen more here.</p><p><br></p>'
