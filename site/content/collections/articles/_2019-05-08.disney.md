      <p>I'm reading the Walt Disney biography, and what's most striking is how long it took him to get any traction at all.
      
      The Disney brothers start their company in 1923 and basically eat shit for 10 years.
      
      Year after year of failed attempts, bad deals, and projects gone bad.</p><p><br></p>
