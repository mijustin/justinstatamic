      <p>And suddenly, around 1933, everything starts to change for Disney.
      
      They get their first real hit, a short film called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-x_QRww3Bk">The three pigs</a>". Mickey Mouse, who'd been around since 1928, hits&nbsp;peak popularity. Donald Duck gets introduced in 1934, and people go crazy for him.</p><p>For years, Walt Disney was knocking on every door, desperate for meetings. He tried to convince big studio executives that animation was the future. But they ignored him and treated him badly. Walt was so desperate for funding that he signed some really bad distribution deals,&nbsp;</p><p>And now, a decade later, he's the toast of Hollywood. Everyone wants to meet him.
      
      Suddenly, he doesn't need to bang on doors; they're just opening for him.</p>
