      <p>While there's lots of innovation in technology, there's not much innovation in <strong>how businesses make money.</strong></p>
      <p>Regardless of whether you're running a podcast, a newspaper, or a YouTube channel, there are really only two revenue models:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Sell advertising to sponsors who want to sell to your audience</li>
      <li>Sell a product / service to your audience</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you want to sell <strong>ads</strong>, this history is instructive:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1487" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/newspaperadsdecline2.jpg" alt="The decline of newspaper advertising and what it means for podcasts" width="659" height="449" /></p>
      <p>This is from <a href="https://www.baekdal.com/blog/what-killed-the-newspapers-google-or-facebook-or/">Thomas Baekdal's article</a>, and it's worth a read. Specifically his distinction between "high purchase intent advertising" (Google) and "low intent advertising" (newspapers and Facebook).</p>
      <p><strong>The challenge for podcasters</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>There aren't that many companies interested in "low intent advertising."</em> These are usually branding plays: MailChimp, Ford, Squarespace, GoDaddy. They're the same companies that advertise on the Super Bowl. It's a small pool, who have an increasing number of options.</li>
      <li><em>A podcast's competition in the "low intent" space isn't just other podcasts.</em> It's also Facebook, radio, and television.</li>
      <li><em>Podcasts' biggest threat is Facebook's targeting &amp; conversion tracking</em>. On Facebook, an advertiser can pay per conversion <strong>and</strong> specify what demographic they want to target (geography, interests, gender, age, income). They also get instant feedback (stats start appearing within hours of starting a campaign).</li>
      <li><em>Advertisers in this space are always looking for the channel with the biggest reach.</em> In the beginning, a small indie podcast with 10,000 downloads per month could get sponsorship. But as some shows developed bigger and bigger audiences, brand advertisers naturally began to expect <strong>more reach.</strong> That trend will continue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even Alex Blaumberg, of Gimlet, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hearstartup/bonus-but-wait-theres-more">is feeling this squeeze</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><p>There's one more problem with advertising, and it's a business problem. I'm not sure the money will keep flowing. Right now advertising rates are high. But historically they've fluctuated quite a bit. The companies lining up to advertise on our shows right now might evaporate. Or, decide they're willing to pay us, just a lot less. You need to diversify your revenue base.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Given this environment, it's going to get increasingly difficult for small indie shows to make a living through advertising.</p>
