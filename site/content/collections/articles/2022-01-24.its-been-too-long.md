    text: '<p>We had plenty of time to talk about the past 4 years of building Transistor, and what it''s meant to us.</p><p>The thing is, back when we started, our progress felt slow. We were impatient to reach our goal of being able to work on Transistor full-time together.</p><p>Looking back at it now, I can''t believe how fast everything happened. It took 14 months for us to go from $0 in revenue to $10,000 a month. But it only took 4 months for us to go from $10k to $20k in revenue.</p><p>Reaching your goals really is "gradually and then suddenly." It feels like it''s a slow slog, until one day you wake up, and realize you''ve made it.</p><p>Now, Jon and I have new goals for Transistor. We''re really&nbsp;<a href="https://saas.transistor.fm/episodes/founders-retreat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fired up</a>&nbsp;about what we''re going to build in 2022.</p><p>But it was nice to take a moment, look back, and see how far we''ve come.</p><p>I am unbelievably grateful for&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this company</a>, our customers, our team, and my partnership with Jon.</p><p>It''s been seriously life-changing. ðŸ’¯</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br>â€‹<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mijustin</a>â€‹</p>'
