      <p>If you're a programmer building software, or a SaaS (Software as a Service), this post should help you answer the question: "What would make someone buy my app?"</p>
      <p>This is the story of why I bought software from a guy named Peter.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><em>(Note: if you like this post, <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">you'll probably like my book</a>.)</em></p>
      <p>Imagine the following scenes in my customer journey:</p>
      <h2>Scene 1: "f*ck it, we'll do it live!"</h2>
      <p>Over the past few years, I've been developing a WordPress theme called Brutal. It's a simple site design based on the brutalist aesthetic.</p>
      <p>Initially, I made all my theme changes inside WordPress. It's not a client project, so I wasn't too worried about making changes on my live site. I'd just log in to WordPress admin, edit my theme, and click "update."</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1653" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/do-it-live.png" alt="Fuck it! We'll do it live!" width="1566" height="484" /></p>
      <p>Eventually, I started making mistakes. I'd change some code, screw something up, and have no way of reverting to a previous version.</p>
      <p>I needed some version control. So I created a git repository and <a href="https://github.com/mijustin/brutal-theme">hosted it on GitHub</a>.</p>
      <p>My new process looked like this:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Open the theme files locally in Atom, my text editor.</li>
      <li>Make my changes.</li>
      <li>Push the changes up to GitHub.</li>
      <li>Transfer my files to my web server via FTP.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Scene 2: the frustration</h2>
      <p>As I worked with this new process, I kept muttering things under my breath:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Argh! There's got to be a better way to do this."</p></blockquote>
      <p>Having to push my changes through git and FTP every time was frustrating. Sometimes I forgot to sync my changes to GitHub. I never knew where my latest version was.</p>
      <p>Every time I went through that process, I got frustrated:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"I'VE HAD ENOUGH! There's got to be a plugin that does this."</p></blockquote>
      <p>That day I added a card to my Trello board that said: "GitHub workflow for WordPress themes. (Plugin that exists)."</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1650" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/github-wordpress-plugin.png" alt="GitHub Wordpress Plugin on my Trello board" width="2238" height="540" /></p>
      <h2>Scene 3: the search for software</h2>
      <p>I created that to-do on July 1st.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't until July 10th, at 4:31 pm that I said:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Damn it; it's time to find a solution for this problem."</p></blockquote>
      <p>To start, I went to Google and typed in: "deploy WordPress theme changes with git."</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1651" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/google-search.png" alt="Google search deploy wordpress theme changes with git" width="1598" height="266" /></p>
      <p>A bunch of results came up; mostly blog posts.</p>
      <p>I clicked on "<a href="http://culttt.com/2013/04/08/how-to-deploy-wordpress-themes-with-git/">How to deploy WordPress themes with Git</a>" first. It seemed too technical for me. I don't use git from the command line (I use GitHub's desktop app), and the workflow they described didn't match up with mine. I clicked back to the search results.</p>
      <p>The next result I found was for a SaaS called <a href="https://buddy.works/">Buddy</a>. It promised, "Continuous Delivery, simplified." But again, it didn't seem right for me. I was looking for something specifically built for WordPress. Furthermore, the screenshot showed a terminal-based workflow (which didn't appeal to me). I went back to search.</p>
      <p>I kept clicking and searching, but none of the search results promised a solution that was right for me.</p>
      <p>My fifth click was on <a href="https://wppusher.com/">WP Pusher</a> made by a developer named <a href="https://twitter.com/petersuhm">Peter Suhm</a>.</p>
      <p>Almost immediately, I knew I'd found my match.</p>
      <h2>Scene 3: "I think I've found the solution!"</h2>
      <p>Here is what appealed to me about WP Pusher:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>It had "WP" in the name, indicating that it was built specifically with WordPress in mind.</li>
      <li>There were no screenshots of the terminal, signalling that this product wouldn't be too technical for me.</li>
      <li>The headline "From Git to WordPress" caught my attention, but it was the sub-header that grabbed me: "Deploy your plugins and themes directly from GitHub and never again copy files over FTP."</li>
      <li>The screenshot on the right showed what the plugin setup would look like in WordPress. I could instantly envision myself using it on my site.</li>
      <li>There was a large "Download" button. This told me I'd be able to try the plugin right away, without having to pay first.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This landing page is doing a bunch of things right.</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1652" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wp-pusher-homepage.png" alt="WP Pusher homepage" width="2738" height="1246" /></p>
      <p>First, the page immediately answers the questions: "Who is this for?" and "What are they struggling with?" It's apparent that WP Pusher is for WordPress users trying to figure out their git workflow.</p>
      <p>Next, he paints a vision of a better life: "Deploy your theme directly from GitHub and never again copy files over FTP."</p>
      <p><strong>Important: </strong>you can't just talk about the pain the visitor is experiencing, you need to show them how you're going to make their life better!</p>
      <p>Finally, Peter gives potential users a quick way to download and try the plugin.</p>
      <h2>Scene 4: "Let's try this out"</h2>
      <p>Now it's time to install the plugin and see if it works for me. I uploaded the plugin and got started.</p>
      <p>A user's first interaction with software will determine if they're going to invest the time in using it.</p>
      <p>I was asking questions like:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Does it feel well made?</li>
      <li>Is this going to be easy to configure?</li>
      <li>Does it work?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After installing, WP Pusher shows you this welcome screen:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1654" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/get-started.png" alt="WP Pusher welcome screen" width="3000" height="1258" /></p>
      <p>I skipped over the "License" tab and clicked on the GitHub tab. It asks you to generate a GitHub token, and auth with GitHub. Done.</p>
      <p>After that, I chose the GitHub repository I wanted to use and connected it to the theme on my WordPress site.</p>
      <p>Everything's in place. Now it's time for the moment of truth.</p>
      <h2>Scene 5: the moment of truth</h2>
      <p>Does it work?</p>
      <p>I make some edits on <code>index.php</code>, and sync to GitHub.</p>
      <p>Then I log into WordPress. Did it work? I can't tell.</p>
      <p>I go into the WP Pusher settings and see an "Update theme" button. I click it.</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1655" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-theme.png" alt="Update theme button - WP Pusher" width="1606" height="778" /></p>
      <p>EUREKA.</p>
      <p>It works. It pulls my changes from GitHub into WordPress.</p>
      <p>It's here I notice that "Push-to-Deploy" is disabled. After digging into the documentation, I figure out how to enable that.</p>
      <p>Ok, let's try it again:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Make an edit on my machine.</li>
      <li>Push changes to GitHub.</li>
      <li>Look at the template on my WordPress site.</li>
      <li>HOLY SHIT IT UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It's important for me to note that at <strong>this moment </strong>I feel like an absolute badass.</p>
      <p>I want to share my discovery with the world! I write this tweet:</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/884573512031019008</p>
      <h2>Scene 6: Close the deal</h2>
      <p>I've just had my eureka moment. My life has been made better because of this plugin.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm ready to give Peter my money... but then I ran into a snag.</strong></p>
      <p>Here's the problem: there's no compelling reason for me to upgrade. There's a single line on the settings page that reads:</p>
      <blockquote><p>You haven't registered any license key for this installation. <a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING">Buy one here</a>.</p></blockquote>
      <p>I want to support Peter, so I click buy.</p>
      <p>I see these options:</p>
      <p><a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1656 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/buy.png" alt="Pricing grid for Wordpress plugin" width="2134" height="810" /></a></p>
      <p>Immediately, I have a few objections:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Do I even need to pay?</strong> I'm only using it on one site, with a public repository.</li>
      <li><strong>None of these categories fit me</strong>. I'm not a freelancer, agency, or big agency. Is there no personal license?</li>
      <li><strong>Why is this a yearly subscription? </strong>Does Peter have ongoing server costs? If I don't want email support, can I just pay once? What reoccurring value do I get with the subscription?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I almost clicked away, but I decide to click "Buy now." Next, I see:</p>
      <p><a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1657 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/checkout.png" alt="WordPress plugin checkout screen" width="1062" height="1120" /></a></p>
      <p>I can now see that <strong>there is</strong> a personal license. At $39 it feels reasonable (although I'm still feeling a bit miffed about the subscription part). I can't see what I get for that $39, but I'm assuming it means one site and the use of a private repository.</p>
      <p>Ok.</p>
      <p>My next objection: there's no PayPal option!</p>
      <p>I know PayPal is evil, and a pain in the ass. But for many of us, PayPal is where we keep our <strong>play money</strong>. It's a guilt-free spending account.</p>
      <p>Using my credit card feels like a bigger commitment. First, many of us outside of the US don't have a USD credit card, so we have to pay high conversion rates. Second, the more recurring subscriptions I see on my credit card statement, the more anxiety I have. I don't get the same stress from PayPal subscriptions.</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/brnnlmkn/status/848186169263357952</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> getting me to spend my PayPal money is easier than getting my credit card.</p>
      <h2>How to get people to buy your software (or SaaS)</h2>
      <p>If you're like me, you might get notifications every time someone buys your product.</p>
      <p><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1658 size-full" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-15-at-10.43-AM.png" alt="Marketing for Developers purchase notification" width="1162" height="112" /></a></p>
      <p><strong>But these payments don't tell the whole story.</strong> You see only one event in a series of events. What are you missing?</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Everything that happened <em>before</em> the sale (what circumstances lead to the sale?)</li>
      <li>Everything that happened <em>after </em>the sale (did the customer use the product? Were they satisfied? Did they tell anyone about it?)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Understanding your customer's journey is the key to unlocking more sales.</strong> Once you see the progress they're trying to make you can optimize for every step: from initial discovery to purchase to satisfied customer.</p>
      <p>Here's what your marketing strategy should look like:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Optimize discovery </strong>– you want to reach people who've had their "f*ck this, I've got to solve this" moment. For most software products, this is going to mean targeting the right search keywords on Google. (Meeting people where they're at)</li>
      <li><strong>Create a landing page that makes visitors say "Yes! This is for me!" </strong>– I discounted the first four search results because I didn't feel like they understood my problem or my context. Have a clear understanding of who your product is for, and the struggle the face.</li>
      <li><strong>Give users a quick win </strong>– I was sold on Peter's plugin as soon as I pushed to GitHub and saw my theme update automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Give users a reason to pay you </strong>– Peter could ask users to pay once they pass a certain <em>usage threshold</em>. For example, users get five deploys free. After that, they need to buy a license. If I'm getting recurring value from a product, I'm highly incentivized to buy it.</li>
      <li><strong>Make it easy for users to pay you </strong>– optimize your checkout process continuously. Figure out where users get stuck, and what objections they have. Reduce the friction!</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>Peter just gave me a <a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING">20% off coupon</a> for anyone that wants to try <a href="https://dashboard.wppusher.com/checkout?coupon=DEVMARKETING">WP Pusher</a>.</p>
