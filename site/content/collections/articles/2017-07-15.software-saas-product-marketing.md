    text: '<p>If you''re a programmer building software, or a SaaS (Software as a Service), this post should help you answer the question: "What would make someone buy my app?"</p><p>This is the story of why I bought software from a guy named Peter.</p><p>Imagine the following scenes in my customer journey:</p><h2>Scene 1: make changes on my live site</h2><p>Over the past few years, I''ve been developing a WordPress theme called Brutal. It''s a simple site design based on the brutalist aesthetic.</p><p>Initially, I made all my theme changes inside WordPress. It''s not a client project, so I wasn''t too worried about making changes on my live site. I''d just log in to WordPress admin, edit my theme, and click "update."</p>'

    text: '<p>Eventually, I started making mistakes. I''d change some code, screw something up, and have no way of reverting to a previous version.</p><p>I needed some version control. So I created a git repository and <a href="https://github.com/mijustin/brutal-theme">hosted it on GitHub</a>.</p><p>My new process looked like this:</p><ol><li>Open the theme files locally in Atom, my text editor.</li><li>Make my changes.</li><li>Push the changes up to GitHub.</li><li>Transfer my files to my web server&nbsp;via FTP.</li></ol><h2>Scene 2: the frustration</h2><p>As I worked with this new process, I kept muttering things under my breath:</p><blockquote><p>"Argh! There''s got to be a better way to do this."</p></blockquote><p>Having to push my changes through git and FTP every time was frustrating. Sometimes I forgot to sync my changes to GitHub. I never knew where my latest version was.</p><p>Every time I went through that process, I got frustrated:</p><blockquote><p>"I''VE HAD ENOUGH! There''s got to be a plugin that does this."</p></blockquote><p>That day I added a card to my Trello board that said: "GitHub workflow for WordPress themes. (Plugin that exists)."</p>'

    text: '<p>A bunch of results came up; mostly blog posts.</p><p>I clicked on "<a href="http://culttt.com/2013/04/08/how-to-deploy-wordpress-themes-with-git/">How to deploy WordPress themes with Git</a>" first. It seemed too technical for me. I don''t use git from the command line (I use GitHub''s desktop app), and the workflow they described didn''t match up with mine. I clicked back to the search results.</p><p>The next result I found was for a SaaS called&nbsp;<a href="https://buddy.works/">Buddy</a>. It promised, "Continuous Delivery, simplified." But again, it didn''t seem right for me. I was looking for something specifically built for WordPress. Furthermore, the screenshot showed a terminal-based workflow (which didn''t appeal to me). I went back to search.</p><p>I kept clicking and searching, but none of the search results promised a solution that was right for me.</p><p>My fifth click was on <a href="https://wppusher.com/">WP Pusher</a>&nbsp;made by a developer named&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/petersuhm">Peter Suhm</a>.</p><p>Almost immediately, I knew I''d found my match.</p><h2>Scene 3: "I think I''ve found the solution!"</h2><p>Here is what appealed to me about WP Pusher:</p><ol><li>It had "WP" in the name, indicating that it was built specifically with WordPress in mind.</li><li>There were no screenshots of the terminal, signalling that this product wouldn''t be too technical for me.</li><li>The headline "From Git to WordPress" caught my attention, but it was the sub-header that grabbed me: "Deploy your plugins and themes directly from GitHub and never again copy files over FTP."</li><li>The screenshot on the right showed what the plugin setup would look like in WordPress. I could instantly envision myself using it on my site.</li><li>There was a large "Download" button. This told me I''d be able to try the plugin right away, without having to pay first.</li></ol><p>This landing page is doing a bunch of things right.</p>'

I uploaded the plugin and got started.</p><p>A user''s first interaction with software will determine if they''re going to invest the time in using it.</p><p>I was asking questions like:</p><ol><li>Does it feel well made?</li><li>Is this going to be easy to configure?</li><li>Does it work?</li></ol><p>After installing, WP Pusher shows you this welcome screen:</p>'

Let''s move on.</p><p>My next objection: there''s no PayPal option!</p><p>I know PayPal is evil (and a pain in the ass). But for many of us, PayPal is where we keep our&nbsp;<strong>play money</strong>. It''s a guilt-free spending account.</p><p>Using my credit card feels like a bigger commitment. First, many of us outside of the US don''t have a USD credit card, so we have to pay high conversion rates. Second, the more recurring subscriptions I see on my credit card statement, the more anxiety I have. I don''t get the same stress from PayPal subscriptions.</p>'

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong>&nbsp;getting me to spend my PayPal money is easier than getting my credit card.</p><h2>How to get people to buy your software (or SaaS)</h2><p>If you're like me, you might get notifications every time someone buys your product.</p><p><strong>But these payments don't tell the whole story.</strong>&nbsp;You see only one event in a series of events. What are you missing?</p><ul><li>Everything that happened&nbsp;<em>before</em> the sale (what circumstances lead to the sale?)</li><li>Everything that happened&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>the sale (did the customer use the product? Were they satisfied? Did they tell anyone about it?)</li></ul><p><strong>Understanding your customer's journey is the key to unlocking more sales.</strong> Once you see the&nbsp;progress they're trying to make you can optimize for every step: from initial discovery&nbsp;to purchase&nbsp;to satisfied customer.</p><p>Here's what your marketing strategy should look like:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimize discovery&nbsp;</strong>– you want to reach people who've had their "f*ck this, I've got to solve this" moment. For most software products, this is going to mean targeting the right search keywords on Google. (Meeting people where they're at)</li><li><strong>Create a landing page that makes visitors say "Yes! This is for me!"&nbsp;</strong>– I discounted the first four search results because I didn't feel like they understood my problem or my context. Have a clear understanding of who your product is for, and the struggle they face.</li><li><strong>Give users a quick win&nbsp;</strong>– I was sold on Peter's plugin as soon as I pushed to GitHub and saw my theme update automatically.</li><li><strong>Give users a reason to pay you&nbsp;</strong>– Peter could ask users to pay once they pass a certain <em>usage threshold</em>. For example, users get five deploys free. After that, they need to buy a license. If I'm getting recurring value from a product, I'm highly incentivized to buy it.</li><li><strong>Make it easy for users to pay you&nbsp;</strong>– optimize your checkout process continuously. Figure out where users get stuck, and what objections they have. Reduce the friction!</li></ul><p><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>Peter has started a new company that does automated WordPress deployments called <a href="https://branchci.com/">Branch</a>. Check it out!</p><p>Cheers,<br>
