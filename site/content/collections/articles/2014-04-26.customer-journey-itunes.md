      <p>Understanding the customer journey is critical to an effective digital marketing strategy.</p>
      <p>Marketing is the process of convincing people to take out their wallets and buy.</p>
      <p>Let that sink in for a second.</p>
      <p>If I've left my wallet in another room, what pushes me to get up from my desk, find my credit card, and come back to finish a checkout?</p>
      <p>One way to understand <em>why</em> people bought a digital product is to examine the sequence of events that lead up to the purchase. We need to look at the customer's journey.</p>
      <h2>I bought $26 of digital products on my iPad</h2>
      <p>Here's a real example from my own life: this is a bit embarrassing, but I just received this receipt from iTunes:</p>

      Comics, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #13 - $1.99</pre>
      <p><strong>Last weekend, I spent $26 on TMNT comics.</strong> Why did I do this?</p>
      <p><strong>I was sick in bed from Friday to Monday.</strong> Laying in bed, feeling nauseous, I needed something simple that could distract me from my illness. I thought a comic could be the perfect antidote: it's not heavy reading, it's easy to consume, and it's entertaining. I found Comixology on my iPad, bought my first comic and was hooked. After I had finished it, it was easy to buy the next one. And the next, and the one after that.</p>
      <p>So it's simple, right? I'm hiring the comics to do a particular job: to entertain me while I'm in bed.</p>
      <p><strong>But that's not the end of the story. There are even deeper forces at play here.</strong></p>
      <p>For example, why did I choose Ninja Turtles? And why did I even think of comics?</p>
      <p>To answer that, we need to go back about 25 years to my 8th birthday party:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-992 size-full" title="My customer journey starts at my 8th birthday party in 1988" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/justin-jackson-8th-birthday-party-1988.jpg" alt="My customer journey starts at my 8th birthday party in 1988" width="604" height="355" /></p>
      <p>That day, my friend Travis gave me a TMNT comic. I was a huge Ninja Turtles fan and was excited to read it, but after the party was over, the comic disappeared. I couldn't find it anywhere.</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-993 size-full" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles original comic book" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tmnt-origina-comic-book.jpg" alt="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles original comic book" width="580" height="444" /></p>
      <p>It's funny, but the thought of that missing comic has stayed with me to this day. I've had a longing to read it ever since I lost it. So while I was sitting in my bed, sick, my real thought wasn't "I should buy a comic" it was:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"I should buy that Ninja Turtles comic I've wanted to read since I was 8."</p></blockquote>
      <p>There's a sequence (affected by different forces) behind every purchase. The folks over at <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/jtbd-timeline.png">JTBD</a> have a nice way of presenting the timeline here:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone wp-image-995 size-full" title="Explore the customer journey: the JTBD purchasing timeline" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/purchase-timeline-jtbd.png" alt="Explore the customer journey: the JTBD purchasing timeline" width="700" height="163" /></p>
      <p>For some purchases, the progression of events happens very quickly. For others, it takes much longer. Maybe even 25 years!</p>
      <h2>Why do people buy digital products?</h2>
      <p>Every purchase has a story. Your job (as a marketer) is to discover that story.</p>
      <p>We can gain valuable insights by looking at the history behind a purchase which we can then apply to building and marketing products. In my case, we can see that <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/74726335849/nostalgia-a-product-designers-secret-weapon">nostalgia was a powerful force</a>, but there are certainly others.</p>
      <p>Understanding these triggers will help you unlock the puzzle of how to reach customers with your message. (<a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/buying-cycle-and-triggers/">Learn more about the customer journey here</a>)</p>
      <h2>Explore your customer journey</h2>
      <p>The best way to understand these concepts is to practice them on yourself.</p>
      <p>Find a recent purchase you've made: something for your business, your most recent Amazon delivery, or a receipt from iTunes.</p>
      <p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>When did I first think about purchasing this?</li>
      <li>What were the circumstances around the purchase?</li>
      <li>Who recommended the product? Who was talking about it?</li>
      <li>What problem were you trying to solve?</li>
      <li>What job were you hiring the product to do?</li>
      </ul>
