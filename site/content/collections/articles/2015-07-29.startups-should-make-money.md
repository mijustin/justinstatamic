      <p>In 1999, you could get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozmo.com">Kozmo</a> to deliver a Krispe Kreme donut to your door in under an hour. For free.<br />
      <!--more--><br />
      People loved it: order a video game, book, or a snack, and it was at your door. The company was featured in an optimistic <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1018/6410164a.html">Forbes piece</a>, where CEO Joseph Park proclaimed:</p>
      <blockquote><p>I'm going to put Amazon out of business.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Investors had given them $28 million to go out and increase their market share. A year later, with additional funding, they'd grown to over 400,000 members.</p>
      <p>Around this time Michael Menduno, editor at <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2000/12/26/right-now-is-not-too-soon">Internet Retailer</a>, made a prescient observation:</p>
      <blockquote><p>The premise behind affordable, same-day delivery is not entirely far-fetched. The problem: No one has figured out how to turn this logic into profit.</p></blockquote>
      <hr />
      <p>Call me old-fashioned but I've always believed that the purpose of starting a business is to earn a profit. An <em>entrepreneur </em>risks their time, money and energy with the hopes of a payoff at the end.</p>
      <p>That seems clear to me.</p>
      <p>And yet, in the startup culture, not everyone agrees.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, entrepreneurs try to earn a profit by creating value for their customers. But startup "entrepreneurs" can go a different route.</p>
      <h2>Acquisitions.</h2>
      <p>Startup acquisitions create a whole new kind of payoff for people starting companies.</p>
      <p>When you're gunning for an acquisition, your whole aim is to make yourself look attractive to a much larger fish. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">This means growth</a>. But not growth the way we used to think about it ("Johnson! Is revenue growing?") but <em>user growth</em>. How many people are <em>using</em> your service? There's this thinking in Silicon Valley that you can lose money as long as you're gaining users quickly.</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/danmartell/status/623268068194689024</p>
      <p>There's always been mergers and acquisitions, but not on this scale. Now, founders are looking for their Instagram moment. Instagram grew to 30 million users, and despite having <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/04/10/150372288/instagram-sells-for-1-billion-despite-no-revenue">no revenue</a>, was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012.</p>
      <p>The idea of building this kind of unicorn is the new dream.</p>
      <h2>The devaluation of sales</h2>
      <p>The downside to a culture obsessed with <em>user growth, </em>is we're raising a whole generation of "entrepreneurs" who have never sold a thing in their life.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Making money takes practice."<br />
      <cite>- Jason Fried, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1985-making-money-takes-practice-like-playing-the-piano-takes-practice">Signal vs Noise</a></cite></p></blockquote>
      <p>I started at a young age: a shy kid, going door-to-door selling trinkets out of a catalog. In high school I sold homemade t-shirts and concert tickets. By college I'd graduated to selling web development services. In my professional life I've had 15 years of selling software, digital goods, and recurring monthly plans.</p>
      <p>Even with all that experience, <strong>I still feel like I need more practice with sales.</strong></p>
      <p>I think anyone <em>can </em>learn sales. But if a founder's whole objective is to get acquired by Google, Apple, Amazon, or Yahoo, they'll never learn.</p>
      <h2>Where to start</h2>
      <p>Ultimately, I'd like to see more profitable businesses. But I realize that reaching profitably can take time. At MicroConf, Ted Pitts had <a href="http://doubleyouraudience.com/microconf/ted/">a great talk</a> about how it took his company 12 years to reach true profitability.</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Profit is what’s leftover once you’re paying yourself a market salary."<cite>- Ted Pitts, <a href="http://doubleyouraudience.com/microconf/ted/">MicroConf 2015</a></cite></p></blockquote>
      <p>So let's start by encouraging new companies to earn revenue, with an eye on becoming real, profitable businesses in the future. This means encouraging young entrepreneurs to <em>get out and sell something</em>.</p>
      <p>My first day in the software business, my boss handed me a phone and told me to follow-up on inbound leads. These are the kind of practices we need in our industry.</p>
      <p>I'm encouraged by programs like <a href="https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab">Gumroad's Small Product Lab</a> that help people make something small, put a price on it, and put it out in the world.</p>
      <h2>How to evaluate success</h2>
      <p>An acquisition is like a wealthy collector purchasing a race car before it's won a single race. In the startup culture, the car is hailed as a champion, despite the fact that it's never won a trophy.</p>
      <p>Instead of basing startup valuations on hazy metrics like eyeballs, signups, and traffic, let's base them on this simple formula:</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, 'Lucida Sans Typewriter', 'Lucida Typewriter', monospace;">revenue - expenses = profit</p>
      <p>Let's start acknowledging the teams that build a car to race, get it on the track, and win some races.</p>

      <span style="color: #808080;"><em> Kozmo, after taking an additional $60 million investment from Amazon in 2000, had it's user count soar to 400,000. But, as <a style="color: #808080;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2001-04-15/what-led-to-kozmos-final-delivery">Bloomberg Business</a> reported, "the pesky little problem of making money remained."</em></span></p>
      <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>In 1999, Kozmo had sales of $3.5 million in 1999, but lost $26.4 million.</em></span></p>
      <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>In 2001, Kozmo shut its doors and laid off 1,100 employees.</em></span></p>
