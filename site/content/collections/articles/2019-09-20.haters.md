A man walked by, visibly distraught, and motioned for him to roll down his window.</p><p>Colin opened his window, and the man started yelling. He was upset about something. (It might have been about how Colin was parked; I can''t remember.)<br></p><p>Shaken, Colin tried to calm him down, but it didn''t help, there was no reasoning with the angry man. He continued to escalate.</p><p>And then he punched Colin in the face.<br></p><p>Can you imagine being in that position? Having a random person become so perturbed that they punched you?</p><p>That story still rattles me. What causes an individual to respond with such violence and vitriol?</p><h2>Festering negativity</h2><p>Fast forward many years.</p><p>In 2017, I was depressed. I was grappling with some hard stuff in my personal life.</p><p>Over time, I''d allowed feelings of cynicism grow inside of me. Eventually, I became resentful towards anyone who seemed happy and earnest.</p><p>I don''t think I ever lashed out at anybody publicly, but I can remember meeting smart, purposeful, twenty-somethings and being off-put by their wholeheartedness.</p><p>Their "joie de vivre" was enough to provoke negative thoughts inside of me.</p><p>I gave <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/laracon">a talk</a> about my battle with these feelings at a conference in New York.</p><p>Based on the response, I''ve learned that all of us are prone to this behavior on some level.</p><p>Our emotional health goes up and down.</p><p>And when we''re feeling down, we can think, do, and say things that aren''t kind.</p><h2>Climbing out of negativity</h2><p>For me, going to therapy was the key to overcoming my negativity.</p><p>With help, I was able to remove the resentment that had been festering inside me for years. Only after I had dealt with the root pain was I able to see clearly.</p><p>(<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/cynical">I wrote a bit about that journey here</a>)</p><h2>Unchecked negativity</h2><p>But left unchecked, being jaded can poison your mind.</p><p>As Gus Razzetti points out <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/how-to-free-your-mind-from-toxic-behaviors-7dd9c9cbdb9d">here</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Negative thinking is deceiving — it initially seems innocuous. Until we fall into a repetitive pattern that ignites a toxic mental spin."</p></blockquote><p>A hurt, bitter, or resentful person will dig into these feelings; they''ll be comforted by them.</p><p>Or, as Nancy Colier says:</p><blockquote><p>"Our addiction to suffering is at some level driven by a desire to feel better."</p></blockquote><p>Perversely, it feels "good" to feel bad.</p><p>Three researchers (Lane RC, Ph.D., Hull JW, Ph.D., Foehrenbach) observed cases of this addiction to negativity.</p><p>They found that folks became "attached to and dependent on various forms of negative behaviors and destructive attitudes toward self and others." (<a href="http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=psar.078.0391a">Ref 1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1763149">Ref 2</a>)</p><h2>Toxic people online</h2>'

    text: '<p>How can you recognize a toxic person online? By their repeated behavior! They are constantly:<br></p><ul><li>embroiled in some form of online drama,</li><li>shaming and humiliating people publicly,</li><li>saying negative things about others publicly.</li></ul><p>You''ll also notice that they:</p><ul><li>hang out with other negative people that like to complain,</li><li>distrust anyone who seems happy or earnest.</li></ul><p>One frustration, especially for victims, is that <b>not everyone recognizes the signs of a toxic person.</b></p><p>In their book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00263ZLGW/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_AIwHDb4CJFW6Q">Toxic Workplace</a>, the authors describe it this way:</p><blockquote><p>"Remember that toxic people are adept at masking the toxicity when it is to their advantage. They can turn their behaviors on and off depending on the impression they want to make." – Kusy, Mitchell&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Further, "toxic people may act differently" depending on who''s around, and who''s watching.</p><p>Many of us don''t like to rock the boat or call attention to ourselves, but Kusy and Mitchell say that accommodating toxic behaviors will only make the problem worse.</p><h2>How to deal with toxic people</h2><p>The challenge?</p><p>Most of the time you can''t reason with toxic people. Remember, for them, "it feels good to feel bad."&nbsp;</p><p>As Lane, Hull, and Foehrenbach point out:</p><blockquote><p>"They have a recurring need for activities that eliminate pleasure and induce a state of dysphoria."</p></blockquote><p>Holloway and Kusy put it this way in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00263ZLGW/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_AIwHDb4CJFW6Q">their book</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"Toxic people are often self-righteous. [They] cannot find fault in themselves. This is the reason that explaining their behaviors to them often doesn’t work."</p></blockquote><p>So I''m not entirely sure what the right solution is for dealing with negative people online.</p><p>Here are my current thoughts:</p><ol><li>We need to ignore people who are consistently toxic and harmful.</li><li>Individually, we should be open to correction from others: "Hey, that wasn''t nice."</li><li>We need to be kind.</li></ol><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ncolier">Nancy Colier</a> (quoted above) reached out in my DMs to say:</p><blockquote><p>"We can''t change the negativity in anyone else, but we can set ourselves free from it.  Separating ourselves from toxic people is crucial to our wellbeing."</p></blockquote><p>Another thought from Holloway and Kusy''s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00263ZLGW/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_AIwHDb4CJFW6Q">book</a> that resonated with me was this idea that fighting toxicity has to be a community project:</p><blockquote><p>One brave person without a system of support cannot solve the problem of toxicity. After all, if it takes a village to raise a child, then most certainly it takes a [community] working together to change the tide of toxicity.</p></blockquote><h2>Feeling punched</h2><p>If you''ve ever felt metaphorically "punched in the face" by someone online: I know how much it sucks.</p><p>If anything, I hope this post helps you realize:</p><ul><li>You''re not alone (this abuse happens to a lot of people).</li><li>Abusive behavior is not OK.</li><li>Comments from a toxic person have nothing to do with you</li></ul><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p>'
