      <p>It's September, and it's already getting colder. Kids are back in school; summer vacation is over.</p>
      <p>Here's something you might have missed: <strong>you have 3 months</strong>.</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <p>We all know that trying to work on our own projects during the summer is hard: it makes sense to take advantage of the warm weather, the sunshine, and the opportunity to travel or take a vacation.</p>
      <p><strong>But the cold months are coming.</strong></p>
      <p>Think about the next three months: <strong>October, November, December</strong>. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is the autumn season: the leaves change colour, it gets darker earlier, and it's colder outside. These are great months for folks like you and I to get work done: it's the perfect time to be in your basement, tapping on a keyboard, covered in a warm blanket.</p>
      <h3>It's time to start working on your side-project.</h3>
      <p>First, you need to work backwards: what happens in December? Christmas. Christmas is a gong-show: there's shopping to do, parties to attend, and relatives to visit. For me this means I don't get anything done after December 20th.</p>
      <p>So that leaves three months. <strong>If you want to build your side-project, this is your window</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here are a few steps you can take:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>It's September 20th today, that means launch day would be December 20th. Envision what you'd like to launch on that day.</li>
      <li>Now open up your calendar. Work backwards from December 20th and schedule all the times you'll work on your project. It's best if you can make it regular weekly times: ie. Saturday mornings from 6am-10am, and Friday nights from 8pm-11pm.</li>
      <li>Create a landing page. Put only 4 things on it: a headline (that says who this is for, and what their pain is), a sub-headline (describing what you're offering), an email sign-up box (for folks to get updates), and a launch date (December 20th!).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is your prompt!</p>
      <p>It's September 20th; what are you going to build?</p>
