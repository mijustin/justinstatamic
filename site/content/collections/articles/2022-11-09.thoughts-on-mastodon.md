    text: '<h3>How to join Mastodon</h3><p>If you want to try out Mastodon, you''ll need to join an instance.</p><p>I recommend one of these:</p><ul><li><a href="https://mas.to/explore">mast.to</a></li><li><a href="https://fosstodon.org/about">fosstodon.org</a></li><li><a href="https://indiehackers.social/">indiehackers.social</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://indieweb.social/about">indieweb.social</a></li><li>(I''m on&nbsp;<a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social/</a>&nbsp;but it''s become much slower with all the new people joining).</li></ul><h3>How Mastodon works</h3><p>Unlike Twitter, people run their own instances/servers (like <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a> or <a href="https://indiehackers.socia">indiehackers.social)</a>. When you join an instance, your username gets associated with that server. Here''s mine:</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@mijustin">mijustin@mastodon.social</a></p><p>It''s similar to an email (name@gmail.com, name@hotmail.com, etc).</p><p>You can still follow people on different servers (you find them in search), and see their posts.</p><p>Each instance is run by volunteers, who pay for the server costs and do moderation.</p><p>You don''t have to stress too much about which instance you choose.</p>'

    text: '<h3>Content warnings on Mastodon</h3><p>Mastodon has a feature for posts called "Content Warnings." </p><p><a href="https://robot.rodeo/@mike"><u>Mike McHargue</u></a> explains it <a href="https://robot.rodeo/@mike/109270985467672999">here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"Content Warnings are a kindness. If you''re part of the <a href="https://robot.rodeo/tags/twittermigration">#twittermigration</a>, it may seem strange the people use CWs so much here. But, CWs are really helpful. So much of our world is overwhelming, and feed presentation can bombard our nervous systems with triggers. CWs give people time and space to engage with that they have the resources to engage with. It gives them agency. I follow news and politics AND it''s helpful for my PTSD to have the chance to take a deep breath *before* I see a post."</p></blockquote><p>Here''s an example:</p>'

    text: '<p>This feature is interesting (especially in light of the <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/pessimistic">conversations we''ve been having</a> around negativity/pessimism online):</p><blockquote><p>"So much of our world is overwhelming. Content Warnings give people time and space to engage with what they have the resources to engage with.

      <p>I should clarify: the "Content Warning" feature isn't just for "trigger warnings."
      
      It's also a way of hiding content that folks might find overwhelming/tiring/negative.</p><p>For example, in this case, the user is warning others that the post contains commentary about Twitter. Don’t want to see that kind of content? You can ignore the post. If you’re curious, you can expand it to view the full text.</p>
