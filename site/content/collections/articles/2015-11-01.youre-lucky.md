      <p>A few people on the internet just have it made. They had a head start. They got the fame. They got the opportunities. And finally, they collected the riches.</p>
      <p>We look at those people and think: "They're lucky."</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <p>Sometimes this leads us to resent their success. If we're not careful, a dangerous mixture of envy and defeatism can creep in.</p>
      <p>That's just not helpful.</p>
      <p>You want to make new things, be creative and enjoy some success. How can you move forward if you're feeling unlucky?</p>
      <p>Here's what's worked for me: turn it around. Think of all the ways you <em>have</em> been lucky.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Are you connected to the internet? You're lucky. (60% of the world doesn't have internet access).</li>
      <li>Do you live in a peaceful area? You're lucky. (39 million people have been displaced because of armed conflict).</li>
      <li>Do you earn more than $50,000 a year? You're lucky. (You’re in the top 0.31% of richest people in the world by income).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When we make a list like this, we see our good fortune. Anyone who's able to read this blog post is already way luckier than most folks on the planet.</p>
      <p>You might feel behind others, but you're actually ahead of a lot of people. You've been given great opportunities where you are, right now.</p>
      <p>The question is: how will you use your good luck to make the world a better place?</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
