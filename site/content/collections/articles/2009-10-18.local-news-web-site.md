    text: '<p>Tri Area News was a news blog I started that covered the "tri-area" of Stony Plain, Spruce Grove, and Parkland County.&nbsp; While the area already has excellent newspapers, the Stony Plain Reporter and the Spruce Grove Examiner, they are only printed once a week.&nbsp; Tri Area News was designed to give quick, timely news updates to local citizens using Twitter and Facebook updates, RSS subscriptions, and email notifications.</p><p>The really neat thing about this blog, is how I''ve set it up: <strong>everything is automatic.</strong> When a blogger on the site publishes a story, a link to that story is automatically sent to Twitter and Facebook.&nbsp; And at midnight, all of the day''s stories are automatically compiled into an email and sent to the mailing list.&nbsp; No button pushing necessary.</p><p>For this project I also did a lot of work optimizing the site for search engines (like Google), and customizing the theme itself.</p>'
