      <p>Toilets can waste a lot of water.  It doesn't need to be clean, drinkable water; just enough to flush a bowl's contents down the drain.  Why not use sink water?  <a href="http://www.roca.com/">Roca</a> has done just that by combining the sink and the toilet.  The sink water fills the toilet tank, which can then be flushed with the sink's "grey" water.  Brilliant.</p>
