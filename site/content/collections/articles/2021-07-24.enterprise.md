(Especially for our&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/private-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">private podcasting</a>&nbsp;feature).</p><p>But they don''t want to look at&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/pricing/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our pricing</a>, and just sign up with a credit card. Inevitably, they''ll want to&nbsp;<strong>book a call</strong>. üò±</p><p>Even when we try to address their questions over live chat, show them demo videos, and send them our FAQs, many of these companies really want to book a Zoom call with me.</p>'

    text: '<p>So, for the past few years, I''ve been doing these demo calls with qualified leads. It''s been an experiment!</p><h2>Is it worth doing enterprise sales calls? Let''s do the math.</h2><p>I just went through my calendar and counted every demo call I''ve done since Jan 1st. So far this year,&nbsp;<strong>I''ve done demo calls for 26 companies</strong>.</p><p>We really tried to pre-qualify these folks beforehand. These aren''t small SMBs; most them were big brands you would recognize.</p><p><strong>Of those 26 demos, 50% became customers.</strong></p><p>First, some background.&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transistor.fm</a>&nbsp;provides podcast hosting and analytics. In the podcasting industry, most customers are prosumer or SMB. Our most popular plan is $19/month.</p><p>So back to the sales calls.</p><p>Since January:</p><ul><li>I did 26 personal demos for larger enterprises.</li><li>Those calls took me ~1 hour each, so my time investment was 26 hours.</li><li>50% became customers.</li><li>The biggest account was $1,990 / year. On average, each of these new customers pay $730 / year.</li></ul><p>Overall, those 26 sales increased ARR by ~$10,000. Is that worth it? If doubled-down could we make more money from enterprise customers?</p><h2>Is our SaaS a good fit for enterprise customers?</h2><p>Every market is different.</p><p>For example, if you look at&nbsp;<a href="https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/stats/new-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConvertKit''s numbers</a>&nbsp;(which are public), most of their customers sign up on their $29 plan:</p>'

    text: '<p>‚Äã<a href="https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/stats/arpu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their ARPU</a>&nbsp;(average revenue per user) is also relatively low: $65.</p><p>My guess is&nbsp;<a href="https://convertkit.com/?lmref=erdpyA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Convertkit</a>''s market is similar to Transistor''s: individual creators, small brands, agencies, and communications professionals.</p><p>From what I can tell, ConvertKit doesn''t sign enterprise sales contracts. They''ve built their business on small, self-serve contracts. And it''s working: they have 37,000 customers!</p><p>My guess is that MailChimp, Squarespace, and Carrd are similar: the shape of the market is heavily weighted towards smaller, self-serve accounts.</p><p>Even Atlasssian, a company that did $1.6 billion in revenue in 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AlbanBrooke/status/1418692369608810499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn''t do custom contracts</a>.</p><p><strong>In some categories, serving enterprise customers makes sense!&nbsp;</strong>This seems especially true for SaaS that do per-seat billing. For example, it was revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nachoanalytics.com/blog/what-slacks-customer-list-tells-about-their-potential-live-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of Slack''s revenue</a>&nbsp;came from contracts worth $100k+/year.</p><p>But an enterprise-sales process clearly doesn''t work for every market. There needs to be enough demand, at high prices, to necessitate all that additional work you do to get those customers.</p><p><strong>There''s another important factor to consider: what kind of business do you want to build?</strong></p><p>With Transistor,&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/about/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon and I</a>&nbsp;wanted to build a business that was:</p><p>üë©‚Äçüíª&nbsp;<strong>Small:&nbsp;</strong>less than 5 people.</p><p>üòá&nbsp;<strong>Calm:</strong>&nbsp;low stress, minimal complexity</p><p>üìà&nbsp;<strong>Profitable:</strong>&nbsp;maintain our current margins, without having to commit to more stress.</p><p>Building a business that serves enterprise customers looks a lot different than the company we have now. It would require more staff, more process, more compliance, more legal, more stress, and more meetings. We don''t want that!</p>'

    text: '<h2>So what are we going to do at Transistor.fm?</h2><p>I think I''m going to stop doing demos for bigger enterprise companies.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Supporting enterprise customers would require us to massively change our company (hire more folks) and our product (build iOS / Android apps, add SSO). It would make everything more complex and, frankly, less fun.</p>'

    text: '<p>There are other competitors pursuing enterprise podcasting: I''ve heard uStudio and Storyboard can charge up to $250k/year. But I''m not convinced that the overall demand is big enough to justify the enterprise sales process. (And again, I don''t want to build that kind of company).</p><p>One thing I will keep doing: doing calls with individual creators and podcasters who are creating good work, and fit our customer profile. üëç</p><p><em>This isn''t to say that doing demo calls is a bad decision for other self-serve SaaS. It really depends on the shape of your market, and what kind of company you want to build. It might make sense for you; it just doesn''t make sense for us.&nbsp;</em>‚úåÔ∏è</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br>Co-founder,&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transistor.fm</a>‚Äã<br>‚Äã<a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mijustin</a></p>'
