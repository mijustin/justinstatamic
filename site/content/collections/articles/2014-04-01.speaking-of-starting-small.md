      <blockquote><p>Speaking of starting small... I noticed that you published <a title="How to start" href="http://justinjackson.ca/how-to-start/">your post</a> just yesterday, and already your tweet count for the article is up to 84. Knowing that the weekend is actually slow-time for social media engagement, I'm thinking, "Geez, this guy definitely has some magic marketing sauce" (<a href="http://justinjackson.ca/marketingfordevelopers">you should write a book</a>).</p>
      <p>And that's when I scrolled down the page to your earliest posts, back in 2008 (which is like the olden days in web time), and I see that you didn't quite have the same traction back then (hooray, you're human).</p>
      <p>It's cool to see how constancy, dedication, and continuing to push forward pay off. I enjoy your blog, your podcast, and I'm excited to see <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/marketingfordevelopers">your new book</a> come together. I know a lot of developers will benefit from what you have to share.</p></blockquote>
      <p>It's true! If you scroll to the bottom of <a href="http://justinjackson.ca">my homepage</a>, you'll see my original posts were unfocused. I talked about random stuff (<a title="Yes! Apple TV!" href="http://justinjackson.ca/yes-apple-tv/">tech</a>, <a title="James Jones rocks CTV" href="http://justinjackson.ca/james-jones-rocks-ctv/">TV</a>, <a title="How to build a better Canadian neighborhood" href="http://justinjackson.ca/how-to-build-a-better-canadian-neighborhood/">urban design</a>), and didn't really focus in one direction.</p>
      <p>It wasn't until I starting using <a href="https://gum.co/amplification">amplification principles</a>, that I saw traction. Specifically this meant focusing on an audience, figuring out their needs, and writing posts in response those needs.</p>
      <p>For anyone else starting a blog:Â <strong>find your audience first</strong>. Decide who you're going to speak to. Don't write about everything for everybody. Choose a group of people you want to engage with, and write to them.</p>
