      <p>Thanks to Jason Cohen for originally coming up with this metaphor:</p><p>If you set up an ice cream stand on a busy beach, on a hot day, you'll easily attract a crowd.
      
      You don't need to work at pushing your product towards the market.
      
      People just show up.</p>

      <p>Now, think about what it'd be like selling ice cream on the beach during the winter.
      
      If you worked really hard and did a bunch of advertising, maybe you'd get a few sales, but not many.
      
      It's hard to push a product that the market doesn't want!</p><h3>An example from my life: snowboard retail</h3><p>I've experienced this dichotomy personally.
      
      In the past, I've run businesses where I was pushing really hard to get sales. It always felt like a grind, like moving a rock up a hill.&nbsp;</p><p>In almost every case, I was trying to create a product for a market category, or a specific niche within that category, where there wasn't much momentum.</p><p>For example, in my early 20s, I started a <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/customer-behavior">snowboard shop</a>, right when that category was crumbling. Plus: my niche (the tri-cities area I lived in) likely didn't contain enough potential customers to make the business work.</p><blockquote><p>Customers were already in motion. In the early 2000s, internet shopping was becoming a thing. Kids were discovering they could get the same product, for less, online.</p></blockquote><p>There were many days in that shop where I felt like I was trying to sell ice cream on a freezing day. ðŸ˜‰</p><h3>How to find business opportunities</h3><p>It's better to build your product to conform to the direction the market is moving.</p><p>When you target a solid market (with good distribution channels) and give them a product that they're hungry for, you don't have to do much pushing or pulling.</p><p>Folks who debate with me on this idea will often cite Steve Jobs and the iPhone ("Steve built a product we didn't even know we needed!")</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Steve recognized the market's existing momentum and saw an opportunity:</p><ul><li>"Everyone has a cell phone." (momentum)</li><li>"But nobody likes it." (opportunity)</li></ul>

    text: '<h3>Are you struggling to get product traction?</h3><p>If you''re struggling to gain traction, you likely have a problem in your:</p><ul><li>market category</li><li>channels</li><li>product</li></ul><p>Your issue might be in one of these areas; or all three! But start by looking at your market. The market category you target is the foundation; everything else gets built on top.</p><p>Anecdotally, there are&nbsp;</p><p>You want a market with momentum.</p><p>Here''s another metaphor: think about the difference between a slow stream, and a rushing river. If you launch a canoe in a slow stream, the only way to move is by paddling. A rushing river, on the other hand, is already moving. You''re still using your paddle, but now you''re using it steer your boat.</p><h3>Looking for a great product idea?&nbsp;</h3><p>Start with the market! Learn to recognize existing momentum (in a good market). Then look for opportunities.</p><p>For example, currently, there is a lot of momentum over at Shopify.&nbsp;</p><p>They''re growing like crazy because thousands of new stores are signing up. That''s a clear sign of momentum! The opportunity for new entrepreneurs is in the Shopify App Store. If you can find an area that''s being underserved, you have a real chance of building something that thousands of stores will pay for.</p><h3>Don''t waste your time trying to change people''s minds!</h3><p>Markets move towards solutions on their own; founders can''t pull markets over to their solution.</p>'
