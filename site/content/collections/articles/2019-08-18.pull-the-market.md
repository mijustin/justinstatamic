(momentum)</li><li>"But nobody likes it." (opportunity)</li></ul>'

    text: '<h3>Are you struggling to get product traction?</h3><p>If you''re struggling to gain traction, you likely have a problem in your:</p><ul><li>market</li><li>channels</li><li>product</li></ul><p>Your issue might be in one of these areas; or all three! But start by looking at your market. The market you''re in is the foundation; everything else gets built on top.</p><p>You want a market with momentum.</p><p>Here''s a metaphor: think about the difference between a still pond, and a rushing river. A pond has no movement. If you launch a canoe there, the only way to move is by paddling. A river, on the other hand, is already moving. You''re still using your paddle, but now you''re using it steer your boat.</p><h3>Looking for a great product idea?&nbsp;</h3><p>Start with the market! Learn to recognize existing momentum (in a good market). Then look for opportunities.</p><p>For example, currently, there is a lot of momentum over at Shopify.&nbsp;</p><p>They''re growing like crazy because thousands of new stores are signing up. That''s a clear sign of momentum! The opportunity for new entrepreneurs is in the Shopify App Store. If you can find an area that''s being underserved, you have a real chance of building something that thousands of stores will pay for.</p><h3>Don''t waste your time trying to change people''s minds!</h3><p>Markets move towards solutions on their own; founders can''t pull markets over to their solution.</p>'
