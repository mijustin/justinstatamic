    text: '<p>If you''re selling anything online, pay attention to these two variables:</p><ol><li><b>Unit economics:</b> how profitable is one "unit" of your product or service? (one digital download, one month of MRR)</li><li><b>Sales volume:</b> how many units can you sell every month?</li></ol><h2>Case study: iTunes vs Spotify revenue</h2><h3>Unit economics</h3><p>In the early 2000s, indie musicians could make pretty good money selling tracks on iTunes.</p><p>iTunes sold tracks for $0.99 and gave artists $0.69.</p><p>But by 2012, Spotify was grabbing significant market share (with 20 million total active users).</p><p>Unit economics worked differently on Spotify: they paid between $0.00331 and $0.00437&nbsp;per stream.</p>'

      <p>Proft margin per unit had gone way down (a ~99% decrease).</p><p>This means the artist has to work harder (stream more units) in order to make the same revenue.</p><p>The band Pamplemoose experienced this very thing, as frontman Jack Conte explained to <a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/public/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/patreon-jack-conte-and-sam-yam#paragraph_1517?utm_source=public_transcript&amp;utm_medium=paragraph&amp;utm_campaign=public_promo">Guy Raz</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The transition to streaming was really hard.
      Our streaming revenue was a tiny fraction of our iTunes revenue.&nbsp;The volume [of streams] wasn't making up for it. And so, you know, the the the income started to evaporate.</p></blockquote><h3>The importance of sales volume</h3><p>On iTunes, an artist needed to sell 3,623 tracks to earn $2,500 in a month.&nbsp;</p><p>But on Spotify, to earn the same amount, she needs to get 755,287 streams.</p><p>Because of poor unit economics, the volume required to hit baseline has gone WAY up.</p>
