Do you offer many products for different markets? What’s the breakdown of revenue between the various projects you do?”</p></blockquote><p>I get this question quite a bit.</p><p>Suzie has developed a reputation as the “go-to” person for Snapchat. Plus, she’s built a sizeable audience there. Now she’s looking for a sustainable revenue stream. She is considering a few models (membership platform, online events, etc…)</p><p>Below is&nbsp;my advice for Suzie. I''ve based this information on my experience, which means “these are the things that I did that worked.” These tips might not work for you, or for Suzie, but they’ll at least give you some tangible things to consider.</p><h2>How I’ve made my money</h2><p>Starting in 2012, I’ve been gradually building up product revenue. After years of side-hustle, I finally made the jump to full-time in 2016.</p>'

    text: '<p>I''m a company of one person, so as long as I keep my expenses down, I get to keep most of what I make.</p><p>In 2016, my revenue breakdown looked like this:</p><ol><li><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Marketing for Developers</a> – 55% (Online course)</li><li><a href="https://megamaker.co/club">MegaMaker Club</a> – 20% (Membership site)</li><li><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Jolt</a> – 9% (eBook)</li></ol><p>In 2017, my revenue breakdown looked like this:</p><ol><li><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz/">Marketing for Devs</a>: $75,000</li><li><a href="https://megamaker.co/club/">MegaMaker Club</a>: $54,000</li><li><a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/tinywins">Tiny Wins</a>: $44,000</li><li><a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com/jolt">Jolt</a>: $1,300</li></ol><p>In 2018, I co-founded <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor.fm</a> with my friend Jon. As it earns more revenue, it will provide a portion of my income as well. In the meantime, most of my income comes from my membership site, books, and courses.</p><h2>Digging deeper</h2><p><a href="https://megamaker.co/club">MegaMaker Club</a> is built on top of Discourse, which is open source forum software. It’s a full-stack Ruby on Rails application that can be modified based on your needs. Members currently pay once for lifetime access.<br></p><p><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Marketing for Developers</a> is a course that I host on Podia. Online courses are also starting to feel more like “software.” You log in, you track your progress, and fill out workbooks. Students pay once for lifetime access.</p><p><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Jolt</a> is an ebook. I published it through Reedsy but sell it through Podia. Customers pay $14.99 and download the files.</p><h3>Suzie asks: out of the four platforms, which is the most time / labor intensive?</h3><p>Writing a book is definitely the most up-front work. Writing and editing is an enormous task.</p><p>A membership platform requires quite a bit of ongoing work and engagement; but I also find it the most fulfilling.</p><p>A video course is a good mix between the two. For me, creating video is not as much work as writing. Video&nbsp;also has a higher perceived value with customers.</p><h2>What I’ve learned</h2><p>Here are some lessons I’ve learned that might help you.</p><h3>Online courses &gt; books</h3><p>First, online courses have better unit economics than books.</p><p>Books require an incredible amount of research, writing, editing, formatting, refining. They''re also put under a microscope (critically). A few 1 star&nbsp;reviews and your credibility is ruined. (I talk about this more in <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/courses/teach-earn/introduction/welcome-to-teach-earn">this video</a>)</p><p><strong>Essentially, books are incredibly underpriced for the amount of value they deliver.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, with a video course, I can easily add new video lessons on the fly. Since I re-launched <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Marketing for Developers</a>, I''ve already added 5-8 new ones. I''m also able to interact with students (via <a href="https://ofcoursebooks.com/?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">OfCourseBooks</a>). I can''t afford to give a $9, $15, or, $39 customer that kind of support, but at $295 I can.</p><h3>Membership sites &gt; online courses</h3><p>Membership sites, when done right, can be even more lucrative. You can customize your web application to meet the needs of your users.</p><p>These web applications don’t need to be super complex, or even built from scratch. Open source projects like <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="http://www.telescopeapp.org/">Telescope</a>, and <a href="https://www.zenbership.com/">Zenbership</a> make it easier for solopreneurs to get started. If you’re a developer, you can easily customize these yourself. Not technical? Hiring a developer to do these customizations isn’t incredibly expensive.</p><p>And now, creating a membership site is easier than ever with tools like <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>.</p>'
