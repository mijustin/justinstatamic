Do you offer many products for different markets? What’s the breakdown of revenue between the various projects you do?”</p></blockquote><p>I get this question quite a bit.</p><p>Suzie has developed a reputation as the “go-to” person for Snapchat. Plus, she’s built a sizeable audience there. Now she’s looking for a sustainable revenue stream. She is considering a few models (membership platform, online events, etc…)</p><p>Below is&nbsp;my advice for Suzie. I''ve based this information on my experience, which means “these are the things that I did that worked.” These tips might not work for you, or for Suzie, but they’ll at least give you some tangible things to consider.</p><h2>How I’ve made my money</h2><p>Starting in 2012, I’ve been gradually building up product revenue. After years of side-hustle, I finally made the jump to full-time in 2016.</p>'

      <p>I'm a company of one person, so as long as I keep my expenses down, I get to keep most of what I make.</p><p>In 2016, my revenue breakdown looked like this:</p><ol><li><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Marketing for Developers</a> – 55% (Online course)</li><li><a href="https://productpeople.club?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Product People Club</a> – 20% (Membership site)</li><li><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Jolt</a> – 9% (eBook)</li></ol><p>This year, I’m aiming to make $200,000 in gross revenue.</p><p>We’re only three months into the year, but here is what my revenue breakdown looks like so far:</p><ol><li><a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Tiny Marketing Wins</a> – 71% (Membership site)</li><li><a href="https://productpeople.club/?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Product People Club</a> – 18% (Membership site)</li><li><a href="https://justinjackson.podia.com">Marketing for Devs, Teach &amp; Earn, Jolt</a> – 11% (Online courses and ebook)</li></ol><p>As you can see, my membership sites are now my biggest income earners.</p><h2>Digging deeper</h2><p>I built <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Tiny Wins</a> on top of WordPress but designed it to feel like SaaS. The core offering is video content, but I purposefully didn’t want it to feel like a traditional course. Users get a progress dashboard, a Reddit-style forum, and I can send them notifications based on conditional logic. Customers pay on a subscription basis (the annual plan is the most popular).</p><p><a href="https://productpeople.club/?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Product People Club</a> is built on top of Discourse, which is open source forum software. It’s a full-stack Ruby on Rails application that can be modified based on your needs. Members currently pay once for lifetime access.</p><p><a href="https://devmarketing.xyz?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Marketing for Developers</a> is a course that I host on Podia. Online courses are also starting to feel more like “software.” You log in, you track your progress, and fill out workbooks. Students pay once for lifetime access.</p><p><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jolt?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Jolt</a> is an ebook. I published it through Reedsy but sell it through Podia. Customers pay $14.99 and download the files.</p><h3>Suzie asks: out of the four platforms, which is the most time / labor intensive?</h3><p>Writing a book is definitely the most up-front work. Writing and editing is an enormous task.</p><p>A membership platform requires quite a bit of ongoing work and engagement; but I also find it the most fulfilling.</p><p>A video course is a good mix between the two. For me, creating video is not as much work as writing. Video&nbsp;also has a higher perceived value with customers.</p><h2>What I’ve learned</h2><p>Here are some lessons I’ve learned that might help you.</p><h3>Online courses &gt; books</h3><p>First, online courses have better unit economics than books.</p><p>Books require an incredible amount of research, writing, editing, formatting, refining. They're also put under a microscope (critically). A few 1 star&nbsp;reviews and your credibility is ruined. (I talk about this more in <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/courses/teach-earn/introduction/welcome-to-teach-earn">this video</a>)</p><p><strong>Essentially, books are incredibly underpriced for the amount of value they deliver.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, with a video course, I can easily add new video lessons on the fly. Since I re-launched <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">Marketing for Developers</a>, I've already added 5-8 new ones. I'm also able to interact with students (via <a href="https://ofcoursebooks.com/?utm_source=justinjackson.ca&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=indienewsletter">OfCourseBooks</a>). I can't afford to give a $9, $15, or, $39 customer that kind of support, but at $295 I can.</p><h3>Membership sites &gt; online courses</h3><p>Membership sites, when done right, can be even more lucrative. You can customize your web application to meet the needs of your users.</p><p>These web applications don’t need to be super complex, or even built from scratch. Open source projects like <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="http://www.telescopeapp.org/">Telescope</a>, and <a href="https://www.zenbership.com/">Zenbership</a> make it easier for solopreneurs to get started. If you’re a developer, you can easily customize these yourself. Not technical? Hiring a developer to do these customizations isn’t incredibly expensive.</p><p>And now, creating a membership site is easier than ever with tools like <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>.</p><h3>But...&nbsp;don't start with a book, course, or membership site</h3><p>In <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/teach-earn">Teach &amp; Earn</a>, I recommend this progression:</p><ol><li><strong>Figure out who your target audience is.</strong> If you don’t know which niche you’re serving, it’s going to be difficult to find what they need.</li><li><strong>Determine where your audience is struggling.</strong> Hang out in their world, observe where they struggle. Where do they want to make progress in their lives?</li><li><strong>Create your MVP (a workshop).</strong> After you’ve chosen your audience, you need to create something small that helps them. The best way to do this? A single day workshop. You can run it online or locally.</li></ol><p><strong>I recommend starting with a workshop.</strong> It helps you figure out the answers to these questions:</p><ul><li>Do people want what you’re offering?</li><li>How hard is it to get attendees?</li><li>Do you like teaching on this topic?</li><li>How excited are you to come up with material and lessons?</li><li>What marketing resonated with them?</li><li>What kind of people showed up?</li><li>How did they resonate with the material?</li><li>What could you improve?</li></ul><p>Before you invest a bunch of work building a web app, a course, a membership site, or writing a book, you want answers to those questions!</p><blockquote><p>“Start with a workshop.” – Brennan Dunn</p></blockquote><p>For more information on this, watch <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/courses/teach-earn/introduction/create-your-mvp">this tutorial video</a>.</p><h2>Your next steps</h2><ol><li>Register for <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/teach-earn?coupon=INDIE">Teach &amp; Earn</a>, and go through all the modules. (Get $20 off with <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/teach-earn?coupon=INDIE">this coupon</a>)</li><li>Create a local event on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>, and try to get people to show up!</li><li>Sign up for <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006">Podia</a>, and start making an outline for your online course.</li></ol><h2>Final thoughts (you likely won’t do this)</h2><p>My big advice here is: <strong>don’t start with building a web app, don’t start writing a book, don’t start creating a course.</strong></p><p>Instead, <strong>do a workshop</strong>. See if you can attract a few&nbsp;folks to a one day event. Focus on&nbsp;giving&nbsp;attendees a good outcome.</p><p>Whenever I give this advice to aspiring entrepreneurs, they usually ignore it. Why? Because putting on a little event at your local library or coffee shop isn’t sexy. It’s not as exciting as buying a domain name, creating a logo, or making a product.</p><p>But if you can’t get five people to show up at a workshop, how are you going to get hundreds to sign up for your product?</p><p><strong>Start small.</strong></p><p>Cheers,<br>
