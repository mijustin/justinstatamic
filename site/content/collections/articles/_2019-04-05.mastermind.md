    text: '<p>Shortly after, we started meeting for weekly Google Hangouts. We''ve done these meetings consistently since then (the only change is that we now meet monthly instead of weekly).</p><p>Was recently asked by Bryan Dubno about how a mastermind works:</p><blockquote><p>I’m thinking about getting a small mastermind group together where we could all get together once every week or 2. I haven’t actually been part of one before, so I’m not entirely sure what the format for something like this should look like. Does anyone have any sort of experience putting something like this together? Any good resources out there?</p></blockquote><p>So I thought I would write down a quick guide on how we started our mastermind, and how we run it week to week.</p><h2>What is a mastermind group?</h2><p>Wikipedia''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group">definition</a> is pretty good:</p><blockquote><p>A mastermind group is a peer-to-peer mentoring concept used to help members solve their problems with input and advice from the other group members.</p></blockquote><p>If you''re an entrepreneur, you probably want to start a business mastermind group. My definition of what I''ve seen most bootstrapped founders run is something like this:</p><blockquote><p>A business mastermind is a weekly or monthly meeting, with 3-8 regular members. Many times, the members are distributed, and so the call is done using Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts. During the meeting, each member describes what they''ve been working on, and what they''re struggling with. The other members listen, and offer advice, suggestions, and critiques.</p></blockquote><p><br></p>'
