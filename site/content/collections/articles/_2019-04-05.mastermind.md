    text: '<p>Shortly after, we started meeting for weekly Google Hangouts. We''ve done these meetings consistently since then (the only change is that we now meet monthly instead of weekly).</p><p>Was recently asked by Bryan Dubno about how a mastermind works:</p><blockquote><p>I’m thinking about getting a small mastermind group together where we could all get together once every week or 2. I haven’t actually been part of one before, so I’m not entirely sure what the format for something like this should look like. Does anyone have any sort of experience putting something like this together? Any good resources out there?</p></blockquote><p>So I thought I would write down a quick guide on how we started our mastermind, and how we run it week to week.</p><h2>What is a mastermind group?</h2><p>Wikipedia''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group">definition</a> is pretty good:</p><blockquote><p>A mastermind group is a peer-to-peer mentoring concept used to help members solve their problems with input and advice from the other group members.</p></blockquote><p>If you''re an entrepreneur, you probably want to start a business mastermind group. My definition of what I''ve seen most bootstrapped founders run is something like this:</p><blockquote><p>A business mastermind is a weekly or monthly meeting, with 3-8 regular members. Many times, the members are distributed, and so the call is done using Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts. During the meeting, each member describes what they''ve been working on, and what they''re struggling with. The other members listen, and offer suggestions, and critiques. These meetings are also a time to celebrate any wins each member might have.</p></blockquote><h2>How we met and started our mastermind</h2><p>In my case, I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/pjrvs">Paul Jarvis</a> and Jarrod Drysdale. I''d met them both on the internet, and they''d both been on <a href="https://productpeople.tv">my podcast</a>.</p><p>I thought we would be a good fit because, in 2014, we were all going through transitions:</p><ul><li>Paul was becoming known as a writer, but was still doing freelance design work. He was working on his first course (The Creative Class), and wanted to move into product development.</li><li>Jarrod had released a book called Bootstrapping Design that had done really well and was looking to build his next product.</li><li>I was doing contract work for a startup in Portland, and had just released a little ebook. I was working on <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz">Marketing for Developers</a> on the side (but hadn''t launched it yet).</li></ul><p>We did our initial call, and we all agreed that we had good chemistry.</p><h2>How to find your mastermind members</h2><p>This is tricky. For a mastermind to work, members need to be aligned a few different ways:</p><ul><li>They should be at roughly the same stage in their business</li></ul><p>There are services like <a href="https://mastermindjam.com/">Mastermind Jam</a> that will match you, but I''ve never used them.</p>'
