      <p>Marco Arment is wondering why his <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/02/16/google-and-blogs-shit">blog traffic</a> is going down. His theory is that mobile apps and "bite-sized social content" are taking readers away:</p>
      <p><!--more--></p>
      <blockquote><p>
        Publishers are relying more on social traffic not because Google’s squeezing them out, but because that’s where everyone went. The dominance of mobile usage, social networks, and YouTube, plus attention-competition from apps, are the real problems for web publishers and blog writers.
      </p></blockquote>
      <p>I think what we're seeing here is something different. The "old guard" of blogging (folks like <a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Gruber</a>, and <a href="http://kottke.org/">Kotke</a>) built their traffic, and their following, using RSS and / or SEO. People subscribed to their blogs using Google Reader, and read every day. Or, people searched for certain keywords, and found a post (this was especially true when Google used to promote it's <a href="https://www.google.com/blogsearch?gws_rd=ssl">Google Blog Search</a>).</p>
      <p>But times have changed.</p>
      <p>For newer bloggers, like myself, most of our traffic comes from four major sources:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>News aggregators like Hacker News, Reddit and Flipboard</li>
      <li>Our own mailing list (more on this later)</li>
      <li>People sharing the post on social media (primarily Twitter for me)</li>
      <li>Inbound links from other blogs / publications</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For <a href="http://justinjackson.ca">this</a> blog, Google search has never been a big referrer of traffic. In the last 2 years, I've had over 1,028,398 pageviews (from 607,256 unique visitors). About 4.29% of those came from Organic Search.</p>
      <p>https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/567436487223148544</p>
      <p>Likewise, RSS subscribers were never a huge source of traffic for me. When <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.ca/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html">Google Reader was shut down</a> in 2013, my blog wasn't impacted at all. Most of my readers were already using other subscription + discovery formats: Twitter, subscribing to my email list, Flipboard, etc...</p>
      <h3>Email lists are more important than ever</h3>
      <p>Marco quotes <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/02/is-google-making-the-web-stupid.html">this Seth Godin piece</a>, but I'd like to highlight a different passage:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
        If you’re a content provider, the shift to mobile, and to social and the shift in Google’s priorities mean that it’s worth a very hard look at the value of permission (i.e. the subscribers to this blog are its backbone).
      </p></blockquote>
      <p><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/newsletter">Like me</a>, Seth has a mailing list. He calls those subscribers the "backbone" of his blog.</p>
      <p>I think email has always been a good way to syndicate content, for the following reasons:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Email is an open and universal platform that's not going away</li>
      <li>Everyone has an email address and checks it every day</li>
      <li>If people subscribe to your list, they have a high value of trust that you'll send them good stuff</li>
      <li>Unlike other platforms (like RSS + Google Reader) you don't have to depend on a single channel to get your content out to your readers</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I've seen my own reading patterns change as well. I read more than ever, but instead of RSS, I'm using these to find content:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Mailing list subscriptions</li>
      <li>Twitter</li>
      <li>Zite + Flipboard</li>
      <li>Hacker News, Reddit, etc...</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>People are still reading</h3>
      <p>Statistically, I'm still seeing strong numbers to my blog. Anecdotally, I still meet lots of people who read blogs daily.</p>
      <p>Just today, I randomly met <a href="https://twitter.com/leif">Leif</a> from <a href="https://www.giftbit.com/?utm_source=justinjackson">GiftBit</a> at a coffee shop. He followed up with this email:</p>
      <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1141" style="border: 1px #ccc solid;" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/leif-baradoy-giftbit.png" alt="Leif Baradoy from GiftBit" width="712" height="159" /></p>
      <p>Yes, Google's changes over the past 2 years have affected how people discover content. But I don't think people have moved on to "dicking around in apps and snacking on bite-sized social content."</p>
      <p>People are still reading.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
