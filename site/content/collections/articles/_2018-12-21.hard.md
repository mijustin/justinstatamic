    text: '<p>Jason Cohen has an old&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/startups-emotionally-draining.html">blog post</a>&nbsp;from 2011 where he reveals:<br></p><blockquote><p>Getting through this slog of a thing that’s a startup — or anything difficult and worthwhile — doesn’t require that you’re always confident or stoic or smart or right or wise.​&nbsp;It’s about sticking through the tough parts, whatever your personal foibles or weaknesses.​&nbsp;It’s so easy to stop. There’s so many reasons to stop. And that — stopping — is how most little startups actually fail.​<br></p></blockquote><p>This is a long, hard road.</p><h2>The road is long</h2><p>Your ability to launch a product relies on hundreds of events in your history:</p><ul><li>The people you know</li><li>​The skills you''ve learned​<br></li><li>The people who know you</li><li>The content you''ve produced</li><li>The product instincts you''ve honed​<br></li><li>The financial decisions you''ve made</li><li>The professional expertise you''ve developed</li></ul><p>It takes time for all these pieces to fall in place.</p><p>Even when you''re&nbsp;<em>​finally&nbsp;</em>in a position to build something, it takes time to:</p><ul><li>Recognize&nbsp;a need in the market</li><li>Develop&nbsp;a hypothesis</li><li>Test&nbsp;your hypothesis</li><li>​Build an initial app</li><li>Find&nbsp;first users</li><li>Iterate<br></li><li>Etc..</li></ul>'

    text: '<p>And of course, even when you&nbsp;<em>finally&nbsp;</em>get some traction, you''re pursuing the next steps:</p><ul><li>Adjusting your pricing</li><li>Finding true product/market fit</li><li>Finding scalable marketing channels</li><li>Increasing MRR to the point where you can go full-time</li></ul><p>The lesson, of course, is that you''ve never truly made it.</p><p>The road is long, and the road is hard.</p><h2>So, how do you go the distance?</h2><p>Jason is right. Regardless of where you''re at in the journey, your success depends on "sticking through the tough parts."</p><p>So how do you keep going, even when you want to quit?</p><blockquote><p>"Unless you''re one of these incredibly highly motivated people, you''re not going to finish. Most people need some combination of access to information, and access to support." - Mitch Kapor</p></blockquote><p>In North America, we''ve idolized the "lone entrepreneur" who uses their own wits, intelligence, and moxy to achieve success.</p><p>That''s how I started off, in 2008. I set out to learn everything I could about building products people want. I bought books. Read blog posts. Listened to podcasts. Took courses. I went to conferences.</p><p>I made some progress, but it was hard. I didn''t have folks I could talk with regularly (and honestly) about the things I was struggling with.</p><p>So in 2013, I started an experiment:&nbsp;<a href="https://megamaker.co/club" target="_blank">a community for indie makers</a>.<a href="https://megamaker.co/club" target="_blank"></a></p><p>It started as a Campfire chat, with just thirty members. Since then, it''s grown to about ~380 lifetime members, and includes a private Slack, forums, and live events.</p><p>Occasionally, we''ll hang out in real life too.
