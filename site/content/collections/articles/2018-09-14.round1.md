      <p>Thanks for reading and responding to last week's article (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/cost/">The hidden cost of bootstrapping</a>).</p>
      <p>Many readers shared their story with me:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>"I’m currently running a software consultancy, but have dreams of becoming a product shop."</li>
      <li>"I'm a co-founder of a bootstrapped company. Over the last 5 years, we've definitely had to find creative ways to pay our bills."</li>
      <li>"I'm bootstrapping a project with a friend. We're looking for funding that will help us get to sustainability without sacrificing our vision (or our souls)."</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Where'd you get your money?</h2>
      <p>The untold story behind many successful bootstrapped companies is this:</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">They didn't fund their company from customer revenues.</strong></p>
      <p>This seems to contradict the popular narrative of what "bootstrapping" means. On Indie Hackers, M. Naus says:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Bootstrapping means using nothing but revenue generated by your business to grow it."</p></blockquote>
      <p>But is this realistic? Is this really how our predecessors grew their businesses?</p>
      <h2>Where Basecamp got their money</h2>
      <p>We know that 37signals was doing consulting while they built Basecamp (we'll cover that in a future newsletter).</p>
      <p>But many folks don't know about the other way they funded their company.</p>
      <p>Take a look at this screenshot from March 25, 2003:</p>
      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021114132031/http://www.37signals.com:80/training.php"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1876" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/37signals-march-25-2003.png" alt="" width="842" height="747" /></a></p>
      <p>While they were developing Basecamp, 37signals was making additional income from:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>1-day workshops</li>
      <li>On-site training</li>
      <li>Downloadable research reports</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030602175914/http://www.37signals.com:80/report_search_0103.php">E-Commerce Search Report</a>" was a 45 page PDF that cost $99.</p>
      <p>They did a <a href="http://37signals.com/workshop042503.php">workshop</a> that cost $395 to attend ("April 25th, 2003. 10am - 5pm (lunch included)").</p>
      <p>In the early days, Basecamp didn't have the single-product focus they have today. They were hustling to survive!</p>
      <p>They were diversifying with multiple streams of income, and selling training was a big part of that.</p>
      <p>We can see the results of these efforts in Jason Fried's annual review:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"2003 was a good year for 37signals. We got back on track after a challenging 2001/2002 'post-bubble' season."</p></blockquote>
      <p>Could this be a path for us to bootstrap our businesses creatively?</p>
      <h2>Why bootstrappers should teach; for fun and profit</h2>
      <p>Imagine you got a call from the biggest conference in your space (SXSW, MicroConf, Laracon, PAX).</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Hey, we'd like you to speak at our event."</p></blockquote>
      <p>You're ecstatic. You'll be in front of hundreds of potential customers.</p>
      <p>But... you're still not sure. Writing and practicing a talk takes a lot of time (time you could be investing in your product).</p>
      <p>"No worries," says the organizer, "we'll pay you $10,000 to speak."</p>
      <p>Would you do it?</p>
      <p>The opportunity to connect with potential customers, plus the additional revenue, is compelling.</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Creating a course, writing a book, or doing a workshop is similar.</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, it takes time to develop these assets, but when you do, there are many benefits.</p>
      <h3>1. Teaching forces you to start small</h3>
      <blockquote><p>"Starting small puts 100% of your energy on actually solving real problems for real people." – Derek Sivers</p></blockquote>
      <p>How do you want to make your customers' lives better?</p>
      <p>Basecamp is software that helps small businesses improve the way they work.</p>
      <p>But before they built software, they did workshops that had the same aim: "help small businesses improve the way they work."</p>
      <p>They've been helping customers make progress on this same topic for years! (Even before they built software).</p>
      <p>Most of the problems we hope to solve with software can first be addressed manually.</p>
      <h3>2. Make sales now (instead of later)</h3>
      <p>Believe it or not, getting five people to pay you to attend a one-day workshop is more accessible than selling software to anonymous people on the internet.</p>
      <p>I've been selling SaaS since 2008 (at Mailout, Sprintly, and now <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=newsletter">Transistor</a>).</p>
      <p>Yes, selling apps is more scalable, but nothing beats the effectiveness of:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Crafting a sales pitch</li>
      <li>Making a list of potential prospects</li>
      <li>Calling (or emailing) each person manually</li>
      <li>Following-up until you get a "yes" or a "no"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Arguably, it's the lessons that you learn "hustling on the street" that help you to scale your marketing efforts later on. (Which pitch resonates most with people?)</p>
      <blockquote><p>"Making money takes practice, just like playing the piano takes practice." - Jason Fried</p></blockquote>
      <p>Learning how to sell doesn't just happen. It takes practice. And selling a course, or a workshop is a great place to start.</p>
      <h3>3. Build your audience now (instead of later)</h3>
      <p>Many of you told me:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"I'm interested in building an audience for my launch."</p></blockquote>
      <p>Growing an audience takes time! But, you can start to earn people's trust now by teaching them.</p>
      <p>In 2012, I bought a book called "Designing Web Applications" by an author named Nathan Barry.</p>
      <p>The next year, he launched his web app, ConvertKit. I signed up for that too, and now I'm his longest running customer.</p>
      <p>As you focus on one audience, and you keep solving their problems, you'll build momentum. Your audience will grow, and when it's time to launch a "serious" product, you'll be ready.</p>
      <h3>4. Earn revenue and fund your company</h3>
      <p>Alex, the founder of Groove, tells a story about how his software company nearly went bankrupt:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"In those early days, Groove was struggling to stay alive. We simply weren’t making enough to pay our bills, let alone invest in improving the business."</p></blockquote>
      <p>To survive, Groove had to do things differently.</p>
      <p>One thing they tried, in 2017, was running a six-week course. To Alex's surprise, all of their spots sold out. In total, the session raised $120,679 for the company.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Nathan Barry initially funded ConvertKit by investing $50,000 of the money he'd earned from his design books.</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">It's true:</strong> not everyone is going to hit those big numbers.</p>
      <p>But, in your early days of bootstrapping, every bit of revenue helps. An extra $500 or $1,000 can make the difference between burning out, and living to fight another day!</p>
      <h2>What should you teach?</h2>
      <p>Regardless of whether you're employed, freelancing or you've already built a product, the following is true:</p>
      <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">People are paying you for your skills and expertise.</strong></p>
      <p>Your work helps people make progress in their lives. You've probably learned what works, and what doesn't. You've discovered, through experience, how to be more effective.</p>
      <p>This means you have the potential to teach others what you know.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Are you a Shopify consultant?</strong> You've seen hundreds of e-commerce stores launch. What distinguishes the success stories?</li>
      <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Do you do DevOps for your employer? </strong>What hairy situations have you noticed, that you could help other shops avoid?</li>
      <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Did you build an app for the travel industry? </strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">Do a workshop for tourism bureaus on how to maximize their reach.</span></li>
      <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Have you created a spreadsheet that you use internally? </strong>If it could be helpful to others, put it up for sale, and teach other people how to use it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another good source for material is to look over any talks you've done (or blog posts you've written) that got a lot of traction.</p>
      <p>Regardless of what you teach, <strong data-redactor-tag="strong">make it good</strong>.</p>
      <p>Set a high bar for quality, usefulness, and value. Your initial students will remember and could become lifelong customers for your software product.</p>
      <p>(Sidenote: I just looked at Transistor's first 12 customers. 75% were folks that had previously bought one of my courses)</p>
      <h2>What's the best way to get started?</h2>
      <p>Doing a workshop is a great way to start. Begin with a small group of people, and gradually build up to larger groups.</p>
      <p>One hack I've found that works, is starting with Meetup, and doing a free event to practice your material.</p>
      <p>Jon and I recently were in Chicago and put up a Meetup event last minute. We didn't promote it at all, and six people showed up!</p>
      <p>After you've practiced your outline (for free) with a Meetup group, try doing a paid event.</p>
      <p>Another idea that's worked for me is getting your local Chamber of Commerce or trade organization to sponsor an event. They're often looking for high-quality workshops to share with their members.</p>
      <h2>Create your own seed fund</h2>
      <p>How much do "Angel" investors typically invest in startups? It can be as low as $5k, up to $100k, but the median is $25k.</p>
      <p>Getting that money comes with all sorts of strings attached:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>they'll own a piece of your company</li>
      <li>they might want a spot on your board</li>
      <li>they'll eventually want a return (dividends) or an exit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also, just finding and making those deals can take a considerable amount of a founder's energy.</p>
      <p>Instead of spending your time trying to convince an Angel to give you $10k, why not earn it yourself?</p>
      <p>You'll be in good company: experienced bootstrappers like Jason Fried and Nathan Barry used diverse income streams (like PDF downloads and workshops) to fund their products.</p>
