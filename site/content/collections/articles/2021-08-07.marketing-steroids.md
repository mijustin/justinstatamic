    text: '<p>And,&nbsp;<a href="https://cxl.com/blog/dont-build-growth-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Lars Lofgren explains</a>, after a certain point, investing in tracking, testing, and automation gives you diminishing returns. Like squeezing juice from a squeezed lemon.</p><h2>"Growth marketing" burns out categories</h2><p>We''ve now see the scorching effect of growth marketing in multiple categories now. When everyone puts their marketing on steroids, it burns out the customer.</p><p>Hillary Weiss articulated this strongly,&nbsp;<a href="https://startupsventurecapital.com/8-observations-from-a-crumbling-niche-and-how-to-avoid-getting-crushed-6a7e6b2512e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2017</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Strategies that used to be gold standard “cash faucets” are drying up. This is largely because, as one of my fellow writers so succinctly put it:<strong>my niche is marketing “on steroids”</strong>. You’re constantly inundated with affiliate programs, opt-in gifts, funnels, Facebook group invites, ads, retargeting campaigns, webinars, challenges, master classes, and emails, emails, emails day in, day out.</p></blockquote><h1>What does work?</h1><p>Here''s the simple marketing approach we use at&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transistor.fm</a>. I''m not saying it will work for everyone, but it''s worked for us, and might work for you too:</p><ol><li>Have a product that people are searching for ("best podcast hosting").</li><li>Get traffic from SEO, affiliates, content, and optimize for folks signing up on our&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">homepage</a>.</li><li>Ask for credit card up-front, and give a 14-day free trial.</li><li>Track revenue earned from affiliates and other promotions using <a href="https://www.getrewardful.com/?via=justin">Rewardful</a>.</li><li>When people sign up, send an automated email asking them how they found us.</li></ol><h3>Have a product that people are searching for</h3><p>Your aim is to to build a product in a category where people are already searching for a solution. If there''s no underlying customer demand, all your subsequent marketing efforts will be wasted.</p>'

    text: '<p>The purpose of marketing is to take the existing momentum of customer demand, and direct it towards your product.</p><h3>How to get traffic from SEO, content, affiliates</h3><p>The benefit of having a product people are already looking for? A short funnel.</p><p>When people already want what you have, you don''t have to spend a bunch of time educating them, convincing them, retargeting them, etc.</p><p>Instead, you''re making sure that when they do their search, they''re finding you.</p><p>Here''s what the "customer journey" looks like at Transistor:</p><ol><li>Someone decides they want to a podcast.</li><li>They learn they need podcast hosting.</li><li>They search "best podcast hosting."</li><li>They choose Transistor, visit our homepage.</li><li>They sign-up for a trial (with their credit card).</li><li>They become a customer.</li></ol><p>To increase the odds that somebody will find Transistor, we have four main avenues:</p><ol><li><b>Content:</b> blog posts, guides, YouTube videos, Reddit posts, tweets.</li><li><b>SEO: </b>we optimize our content for search using tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com">ahrefs.com</a>.</li><li><b>Affiliates: </b>we <a href="https://transistor.fm/affiliates">partner</a> with folks who have built up high-traffic sites in our niche.</li><li><b>Word of mouth referrals: </b>a combination of good product + good service + good community outreach makes it more likely that folks will <a href="https://twitter.com/itsdavemartin/status/1425840454508109827">think to refer you</a> when given the chance.</li></ol><h3>Ask for credit card up-front, and give a 14-day free trial</h3><p>One thing that really simplifies our marketing at Transistor, is we ask for a credit card up-front.</p><p>We might be able to earn more money if we didn''t require a credit card, but it makes tracking conversion rates a lot simpler.</p><p>The general rules of thumb for conversion rates in SaaS are:</p><p><b>Credit card upfront:</b></p><ul><li>Visitor to trial: 0.75% - 1%</li><li>Trial to paid: 40% - 60%</li></ul><p><b>No credit card upfront:</b></p><ul><li>Visitor to trial: 5%+</li><li>Trial to paid: 8% - 20%</li></ul><p>As I mentioned before, I''m highly skeptical of most "visitor to trial" conversion rates. Trials are easy enough to count, but visitor counts are impacted by bots, spam, ad blockers, people logging in, and folks landing on your website by mistake.</p><p>At Transistor, I''m only tracking two numbers here:</p><ul><li>How many trials do we get each month?</li><li>What''s our trial to paid conversion rate?</li></ul><p>Our trial to paid conversion rate is remarkably steady at 75%, so our primary lever for increasing revenue is getting more trials.</p><p>How do we know where trials are coming from?</p><h3>When people sign up, we ask them how they found us</h3><p>We use <a href="https://userlist.com/?via=justin">Userlist</a> to send trial customers an email when they sign up. In that email, we ask:</p><blockquote><p>What''s happening in your world that brought you to Transistor?</p></blockquote><p>This gives me a sense of what caused them to look for podcast hosting. I then reply to these folks individually, and ask:</p><blockquote><p>Do&nbsp;you&nbsp;remember how&nbsp;you&nbsp;found&nbsp;us? (Or how&nbsp;you&nbsp;heard about&nbsp;us?)</p></blockquote><p>These answers help me understand how people discovered Transistor. The best part? I don''t need any analytics to learn this information; I just have to ask.</p><h3>The only tracking we do is in Rewardful</h3><p>We initially started using <a href="https://www.getrewardful.com/?via=justin">Rewardful</a> to manage our <a href="https://transistor.fm/affiliates/">affiliate program</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I like it because it integrates directly to Stripe. When an affiliate refers someone to us, it''s immediately recorded in Stripe. Once they convert to paid, Rewardful tracks how much gross revenue that particular affiliate has brought us.</p>'
