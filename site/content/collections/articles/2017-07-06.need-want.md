There’s no demand for it in the market, but I’m sure people <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">need it</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">. How do I get people using it?</em></p></blockquote>
      <p>I recently received that question.</p>
      <h3 id="d0ad" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Here’s my response:</h3>
      <p id="eb61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-me" data-creator-ids="a02dd1574d08">The only way for your product to be successful is to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">make something people want.</strong></span></p>
      <p id="d36a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Identifying a “need” isn’t enough:</p>
      <ul class="postList">
      <li id="315b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">People need to lose weight for their long-term health, but most don’t. (In the USA, over <a class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity">68% of adults</a> are overweight or obese).</li>
      <li id="d5c0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">People need to switch to environmental transportation options to reduce air pollution, but most don’t.

      </ul>
      <p id="db65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">However, there are successful products that help people lose weight and switch away from fossil fuels. Their secret? They’ve put their products in a package that people want.</p>

      <h3>Non-software examples</h3>
      <p><i>LA Weight Loss</i> markets it’s program by promising customers something they <b>want</b>: a sexier body.</p>
      <p><img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e93e5022ca41802f4bbc119e8664034" /></p>
      <p>Elon Musk got more people driving electric cars by starting with something people <b>wanted</b>: a fast, luxurious vehicle. (The Model S can go from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds).</p>

      <h3>James' theory</h3>
      <p>My friend <a href="https://jamesclear.com">James Clear</a> has a theory: many positive habits (like a healthy diet) are painful in the short term, but rewarding in the long-term.</p>
      <p>It's difficult for people to do things they know are good for them. The benefit is too far in the future. Eating candy has an immediate reward (it tastes good), but a long term detriment (weight gain, disease). Eating vegetables is the opposite: short term pain, but a healthier future.</p>
      <p>James believes that the secret to motivating people is to align the long-term benefit with a short term reward.</p>
      <p>So if you're going to sell an environmentally friendly vehicle, start by marketing it as a luxury sports car. Early in Tesla's history, people <strong>wanted </strong>the status of owning the exclusive roadster. To help the world reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Elon Musk had to create a product that gave people a short-term reward (in this case, status and speed).</p>
      <h3>How does this apply to building a software product?</h3>
      <p>My favorite example is <a href="https://www.datingring.com/">Dating Ring</a>.</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1692" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/datingring-1024x517.png" alt="Dating ring was a software product that people needed. Needs vs Wants!" width="600" height="303" /></p>
      <p>They launched with a bold premise: a dating site without profile photos. It's a rational idea. If you're looking for a lifelong partner, swiping left or right on a photo is too superficial. Through experimentation, they discovered that a blind date with a group of people was the best way to find a potential mate.</p>
      <p>Single people needed their service, but it wasn't what they wanted.</p>
      <p>Signups suffered because users wanted to see photos of possible matches. Dating Ring was forced to relaunch with a site that allowed people to upload photos, and control their preferences.</p>
      <h3 id="b114" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Minimum Path to Awesome</h3>
      <p id="a893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To succeed, build something that gives users a quick win, and then continues to provide value over time.</p>
      <p id="a823" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a class="markup--user markup--p-user" href="https://medium.com/@robwalling" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://medium.com/@robwalling" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="bb46c9d797d8" data-action-value="bb46c9d797d8" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover">Rob Walling</a> calls this “Minimum Path to Awesome.” In your onboarding, help your customer do something that gets them excited about your product.</p>
      <blockquote id="d29d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><p>If you have invoicing software, maybe it’s when they send their first invoice, maybe it’s when they get paid, we don’t know yet, we just have to take a guess. If you have proposal software, maybe it’s when they send that first proposal. If you have email marketing software it’s going to be either when they get their first subscriber, maybe when they send their first email.?—?Rob Walling (<a class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" href="http://blog.profitwell.com/double-your-trial-to-paid-conversion-rate-with-onboarding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="http://blog.profitwell.com/double-your-trial-to-paid-conversion-rate-with-onboarding">Source</a>)</p></blockquote>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>Recognize that <em>people might not want the progress our product provides</em>.</p>
      <p>Customers don't make purchasing decisions rationally. They buy emotionally and then rationalize their purchase with logic.</p>
      <p>https://youtu.be/OgZhIWquqiw</p>
      <p>Too many smart people are trying to sell products that people <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">need</strong>, instead of building something people <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">want.</strong></p>
