    text: '<h3>James'' theory</h3><p>My friend <a href="https://jamesclear.com">James Clear</a> has a theory: many positive habits (like a healthy diet) are painful in the short term, but rewarding in the long-term.</p><p>It''s difficult for people to do things they&nbsp;know are good for them. The benefit is too far in the future. Eating candy has an immediate reward (it tastes good), but a <g class="gr_ gr_59 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="59" data-gr-id="59">long term</g> detriment (weight gain, disease). Eating vegetables is the opposite: <g class="gr_ gr_61 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="61" data-gr-id="61">short term</g> pain, but a healthier future.</p><p>James believes that the secret to motivating people is to align the long-term benefit with a <g class="gr_ gr_53 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="53" data-gr-id="53">short term</g> reward.</p><p>So if you''re going to sell an environmentally friendly vehicle, start by marketing it as a luxury sports car. Early in Tesla''s history, people&nbsp;<strong>wanted&nbsp;</strong>the status of owning the exclusive roadster. To help the world reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Elon Musk had to create a product that gave people a short-term reward (in this case, status and speed).</p><h3>How does this apply to <g class="gr_ gr_52 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="52" data-gr-id="52">building</g> a software product?</h3><p>My favorite example is <a href="https://www.datingring.com/">Dating Ring</a>.</p>'

      <p>They launched with a bold premise: a dating site without profile photos. It's a rational idea. If you're looking for a lifelong partner, swiping left or right on a photo is too superficial. Through experimentation, they discovered that a blind date with a group of people was the best way to find a potential mate.</p><p>Single people needed their service, but it&nbsp;wasn't what they wanted.</p><p>Signups suffered because users wanted to see photos of possible matches. Dating Ring was forced to relaunch with a site that allowed people to upload photos, and control their preferences.</p><h3 id="b114" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Minimum Path to&nbsp;Awesome</h3><p id="a893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">To succeed, build something that gives users a quick win, and then continues to provide value over time.</p><p id="a823" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a class="markup--user markup--p-user" href="https://medium.com/@robwalling" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://medium.com/@robwalling" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="bb46c9d797d8" data-action-value="bb46c9d797d8" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover">Rob Walling</a>&nbsp;calls this “Minimum Path to Awesome.” In your onboarding, help your customer do something that gets them excited about your product.</p><blockquote id="d29d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><p>If you have invoicing software, maybe it’s when they send their first invoice, maybe it’s when they get paid, we don’t know yet, we just have to take a guess.
