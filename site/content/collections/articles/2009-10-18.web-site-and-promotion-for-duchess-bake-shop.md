      <p>Garner and Giselle at <a href="http://duchessbakeshop.com/wp">Duchess Bake Shop</a> wanted a simple, functional web site.  I also helped them with online promotion: linking to local blogs, improving Google search results, and creating an identity for them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Edmonton-AB/Duchess-Bake-Shop/150536891705?ref=ts">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/duchessbakeshop">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>The online campaign went very well, and created tremendous buzz for their opening week:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>"I first heard of them when <a href="http://twitter.com/duchessbakeshop" target="_blank">they signed up on Twitter (@duchessbakeshop)</a>,  and immediately wanted to check the shop out." - <a href="http://www.inews880.com/Blogs/BrittneyLeBlanc/BlogEntry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10069804">Britney Leblanc</a>, iNews880</li>
      <li>"Word about Duchess spread like wildfire on the Internet – <strong>kudos to their marketing folks for harnessing the power of social media.</strong>" - <a href="http://foodiesuz.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/duchess-bake-shop/">Sue Robins</a></li>
      <li>"Everyone's raving about Edmonton's newest culinary offering: Duchess Bake Shop" - <a href="http://weirdwildandwonderful.blogspot.com/2009/10/helloooo-duchess.html">Twyla Campbell</a></li>
      </ul>
