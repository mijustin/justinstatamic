      <p>Hi, I'm Justin Jackson. Let me tell you a story about how my life changed because of the NBA draft.</p>
      <p>I'm not an athlete. I'm a geek. I’ve been working with SaaS companies since 2008. I was the Product Manager at Sprintly and Mailout.</p>
      <p>Around 2012, I started a podcast called <a href="https://productpeople.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product People</a>. I interviewed people like Jason Fried, Hiten Shah, and Rob Walling. Folks loved it. At the same time, my writing on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justinjackson.ca</a> started to gain a lot of traction. People began signing up for <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my newsletter</a> too. They were coming to me for product &amp; marketing advice for their SaaS, software, mobile, and digital products. I offered <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulting calls</a>. That month I had 17 calls booked (that was too many).</p>
      <p>When you googled "justin jackson" my site was the #1 result.</p>
      <h3>"Are you Justin Jackson from the NBA?"</h3>
      <p>And then, a talented 22-year-old basketball player was drafted by the Sacramento Kings. His name was also Justin Jackson.</p>
      <p>I first noticed it when random kids started asking me questions on Snapchat.</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1701" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-nba-nerd-snapchat.jpg" alt="Kids asking me if I'm Justin Jackson the NBA player on Snapchat" width="960" height="314" /></p>
      <p>I thought it was cute.</p>
      <p>And then, I searched "justin jackson" on Google again.</p>
      <p><strong>It was all NBA.</strong> Goodbye "nerdy guy from Canada," hello "professional athlete."</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1702" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-jackson-megamaker-seo-results-1024x547.jpg" alt="Justin Jackson, from MegaMaker, search results on Google" width="600" height="321" /></p>
      <p>My search traffic plummeted. People started DMing to say they couldn't find my site. When I went to speak at a conference, I had a few people tell me they'd googled me and didn't attend my talk because "why would I want to hear from a basketball player at a tech conference?"</p>
      <h3>Here's what I'm doing about it</h3>
      <p>I'm pivoting everything over to the <a href="https://megamaker.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MegaMaker</a> brand.</p>
      <p>All my <a href="https://megamaker.co/category/articles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best articles</a> on product marketing will live there.</p>
      <p>All <a href="https://justinjackson.withcoach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my products</a> related to product marketing will live there.</p>
      <p><em>(btw – <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/thanks/?convertkit=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Marketing Wins 3.0</a> is coming soon! <a href="https://tinymarketingwins.com/thanks/?convertkit=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to learn more.)</em></p>
      <p>And, ultimately, MegaMaker will become something bigger than just me.</p>
      <p>Already, I've hired Tim, Gary, and Andre to help me.</p>
      <p>Together, we're focused on one job:</p>
      <blockquote><p>"We help digital product companies fix their product and improve their marketing, so that they can grow profits."</p></blockquote>
      <h3>Is there a lesson here for you?</h3>
      <p>On Twitter, folks have been asking me:</p>
      <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1703" src="https://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/question-from-twitter-personal-brand-or-company-brand.png" alt="Question from Twitter: personal brand or company brand?" width="580" height="288" /></p>
      <p>There's a reason a lot of Hollywood stars change their names for the sake of their careers (Marilyn Monroe, Woody Allen). Your name is your brand. The Screen Actors Guild won't let new actors join if they have the same name as another member (there can only be one Chuck Norris ?<span class="redactor-invisible-space">).</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>Pros to using your personal name:</strong><br />
      </span></p>
      <ul>
      <li>If you're selling personal products and services (consulting, books) it makes sense to use your name. Ie. nathanbarry.com/books</li>
      <li>Building a personal brand feels <em>personal</em>. People get connected to you as a person. They'll seek out your conference talks, blog posts, videos.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cons to using your personal name:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Would Nathan Barry have been able to use his name if it was Dave Barry? Not a chance. Dave Barry has been an author since 1983.</li>
      <li>Personal names can't be trademarked (unless it's a unique brand you created).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><strong>Company names have their own identity challenges.</strong> I'm an advisor for <a href="http://partners.withcoach.com/41479/4006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coach</a>, which often gets confused with Coach.me.</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(Incidentally, MegaMaker has its own SEO problems. Search for "megamaker" and you'll see someone else is using my name. Luckily, I registered the trademark in January 2017 and can fight it).</span></p>
      <p><span class="redactor-invisible-space">I used to wonder why founders got so upset when someone used a name similar to theirs. Now I know!</span></p>
      <p>Cheers,<br />
      Justin Jackson<br />
