    text: '<p>Beginning the year this way greatly benefits us as partners and the company. We started to sketch out some of our goals and intentions for the year.</p><h3>Optimizing for search</h3><p>I spent the last few months of 2022 trying to improve <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>''s search results for terms like "<a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/">how to start a podcast</a>" (both on Google and <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1487185703658135561">YouTube</a>).</p><p>While I could have hired someone else to do this SEO work, I genuinely enjoyed learning about it and testing different strategies. A few key lessons:</p><ol><li><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/youtube-video">Ranking on YouTube</a> is a massive opportunity for small SaaS companies.</li><li>Backlinks are really important if you want to rank for competitive keywords.</li><li>Google seems to be rewarding pages with <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data">structured data markup</a>.</li><li>It helps to track your changes and see if they develop results. I''m using the "tests" feature in <a href="https://seotesting.com/">seotesting.com</a> for that.</li><li><a href="https://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique">Skyscraper content</a> seems to rank highest in our niche</li></ol><h3>New Transistor features launched in 2022</h3><p>With a team of four people, we were able to launch a lot more features than in previous years.</p><ul><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/features/podcast-website-builder/">Updated podcast website builder</a> (and new themes)</li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/languages/">Multiple languages</a> for podcast websites</li><li><a href="https://freepodcastwebsites.com/?ref=justin">Free podcast website builder</a> for non-Transistor customers</li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/achievements/">Podcast achievement badges</a></li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/dai-improvements/">Multiple</a> improvements to <a href="https://transistor.fm/features/dynamic-ads/">Dynamic Ad Insertion</a></li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/timestamps/">Episode timestamp links</a></li><li>Multiple improvements to podcast analytics:&nbsp;<a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/analytics-cumulative/">episode comparison charts</a></li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/people/">Guest, host, and creator profiles</a> for podcast websites</li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/mp3-chapters-notes/">Cool MP3 chapter feature</a> that automatically generates timestamps</li><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/changelog/hide-email/">Remove email address</a> from the RSS feed, so you don''t get spam</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1590798734497316865">Big refresh</a> to the <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor marketing website</a></li></ul><h3>Remote team retreat</h3><p>By far, the biggest highlight of the year for Transistor was the <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/team-retreat">team retreat</a> we did in Montreal, Quebec.</p>'

    text: '<h3>Feeling the need for collaboration</h3><p>We didn''t hire anybody new in 2022, but I started to feel like I could use a collaborator on the marketing side.</p><p>I didn''t have the same spark and energy in these last few years as I''ve had in the past.</p><p>In particular, watching Jon and Jason work together in our #dev Slack channel inspired me to team up with some contractors and 2022. I hired <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlbeggs">Jason Beggs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuaanderton">Josh Anderton</a> at various times to help me with the Transistor website. I also collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/iamjeremyenns">Jeremy Enns</a> on a livestream event (hoping to do more of these in the future).</p><p>I plan on working more with Josh Anderton on Transistor''s marketing site in 2023. His design sense, web dev skills, and excitement brought me a lot of energy every time we''ve collaborated so far.</p><h2>Big conference energy</h2><p>Even though we launched Transistor in 2018, I still hadn''t attended podcasting''s biggest event: the <a href="https://transistor.fm/podcast-movement/">Podcast Movement</a> conference.</p><p>So I committed to attending their leading conference in August 2022 in Dallas.&nbsp;</p><p>I''m so glad I did.</p>'

      <p>Even though I'm committed to flying less (I cut my annual flights from 8-10 down to 3-4), I also recognize there's nothing quite like getting together with folks in real meatspace.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm planning on attending Podcast Movement again in 2023.</p><h2>What happened in 2022 (investments + community)</h2><h3>What happened to Meeps?</h3><p>In 2021, Josh Anderton and I started building&nbsp;<a href="https://meeps.app/">Meeps</a>: "A better way to create online communities and memberships." The idea was to stop using Memberful for <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> and switch to Meeps as the community management tool.</p><p>At the time, driven largely by the pandemic, there was a lot of interest in building online communities. Startups like <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>, and <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a> were attracting mega-valuations. It felt similar to the podcasting space when Jon and I launched Transistor in 2018; some good momentum.</p><p>But unlike podcasting, the momentum around communities didn't last long. As Tatiana reported in <a href="https://businessofcommunity.co/">her newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If you’re hoping to grow a community business in 2023, a lot of what you might be hearing right now is not optimistic:
      
      With the winding down of the pandemic, people are finding other social options to occupy their time.
      We are spending less on things that feel optional because of inflation and a pending recession.
      Many of the communities that were started in the last few years are now either ghost towns or defunct.</p></blockquote><p>As we spoke to our early-access customers, it became apparent that building a community was harder than starting a <a href="https://convertkit.com?lmref=erdpyA">newsletter</a>, a <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">podcast</a>, or a <a href="https://blogstatic.io/?via=justin">blog</a>.</p><p>I'm still using Meeps for the <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a> community (and it's working great!). So the plan is to keep Meeps running for the time being. I feel we might find a use case with more traction in the future.</p><h2>A few personal experiences to share</h2><h3>Paddleboarding</h3><p>For much of spring until fall, my wife and I had many days on Kal Lake paddleboarding, which was amazing.</p>

    text: '<p>There''s something about being on the water that we found incredibly grounding. Any worries we had before left would just evaporate as soon as we were floating and paddling. For many weeks we were out on the water 3-4 times. Very therapeutic, a practice we plan on continuing in 2023 when it gets warm!</p><h3>Spending more time IRL</h3><p>COVID restrictions accelerated our trend of spending more time online on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.</p><p>While I''ve benefitted immensely from the relationships I''ve built online, I think the pandemic really showed me how important our real-life interactions are.</p><p>Comedian Matt Ruby recently <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1617590265145098240">commented</a> on this in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ak5CQSVVvI">new special</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"A room full of people coming together to laugh or dance or sing or worship or whatever is the antidote to everything that''s going on that''s negative. We just gotta get off screens."</p></blockquote><p>My favorite moments in 2022 were all related to spending time with people offline: snowboarding with friends, taking my family to Disney (and meeting up with my friend Andrew and his family), going to Vancouver with my wife, visiting friends and family in Edmonton, having my sister''s family visit us in the summer, going to concerts, dancing, karaoke, and going to parties.</p>'
