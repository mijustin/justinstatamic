I''m working from home. The kids don''t go to school. All our old routines are gone.</p><p>The world is chaotic. Every day brings more news, and new measures to fight COVID-19.</p><p>I''m glad we''re fighting it. I also feel pretty powerless. I''m not an epidemiologist, scientist, or doctor (and I''m not going to pretend to be one on Medium).</p><p>Most heartbreaking for me is how local businesses have been affected. My friends Brett, Andrew, and Elle are barbers and had to close up shop. Eric runs my favorite BBQ joint had to lay off his staff and shut down. In fact, all of the little shops in Vernon have been affected. Not in a little way; in a big way.</p><p>I keep thinking about this comment I saw on Facebook from a local business owner:</p>'

    text: '<p><strong>We''re learning how fragile the economic system is.</strong> Not only that, but we''re seeing how critical small business is to a healthy economy. In North America, millions of people are out of work. It turns out, all those local restaurants, cafes, and hardware stores provide jobs for a lot of people.</p><p>Not everyone''s suffering, mind you. </p><p>Amazon''s sales are up by at least <a href="https://www.protocol.com/amazon-delivery-coronavirus-high-demand">$800 million per month</a>. Also, somehow, Jeff Bezos managed to sell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/jeff-bezos-sold-34bn-of-amazon-stock-just-before-covid-19-collapse">$3.4 billion</a> of AMZN stock right before the pandemic hit (and the stock market crashed).</p><p>Jeff can keep operating his business, but my friends on Main Street have been forced to close.</p><p>Jeff''s net worth increased to $110 billion, but small business owners have lost everything.</p><p>Jeff is hoping to hire <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/with-unemployment-soaring-theres-a-run-on-those-100000-amazon-jobs-2020-03-27">100,000 workers</a> this month, but that''s not even close to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business">3.3 million</a> who have lost jobs.</p><p><strong>And all of this makes me angry.</strong></p><p>First, because I''m as guilty as anyone. I''ve ordered a ton from Amazon. With next-day delivery (which they <a href="https://qz.com/1739653/amazon-earnings-report-loss-related-to-delivery-costs/">lose money on</a> by the way), incredible selection, and cheap prices, they''ve reduced all of the friction. Over the years, they''ve trained consumers to shop online.</p><p>Now we can see how important small business is for our economy. Millions of workers are losing their livelihoods. The richest man in the world won''t employ everybody (and who wants to live in a world where we all work for Jeff?).</p><p>I don''t think Amazon should be shut down; although, I do think it should be <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/10/09/break-up-amazon-before-it-does-any-more-damage-to-america/">broken up</a>.</p><p>But now, more than ever, we need to create viable alternatives to Amazon.</p><p>And to do it, we''ll have to beat Amazon at their own game. Meaning, a viable Amazon competitor will have to be:</p><ul><li>top of mind for consumers,</li><li>competitively priced,</li><li>just as convenient.</li></ul><p>Let''s be clear about outcomes here. I don''t want to see Wal-Mart and Costco to win at Amazon''s expense. After this pandemic is over, I want to see small businesses gain <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/margin">more margin</a>, and be less fragile.</p><p>When we rebuild, let''s rebuild main street first.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Justin Jackson<br><a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a></p><p>PS â€“ I''ve got <a href="https://youtu.be/CYWR0_wYQ1w">a few ideas</a> to get us started here:&nbsp;</p>'
