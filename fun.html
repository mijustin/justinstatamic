    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> I thought I'd use my <span class="fun">FUN.HTML</span> to create a little CV for myself on the web. I'm surprised how often I see young job applicants who don't have a personal website. If that's you, feel free to copy my page here, and follow <a href="https://mijustin.github.io/fun/fun.html">these instructions</a> to put it on the web for free.</p>

    <p>I've been building projects online since the 1990s, when I discovered the <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/bbs">BBS scene</a>. I've been working with SaaS companies since 2008, largely in web development and product marketing.</p>
    <p>Today, I'm the co-founder of <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">Transistor</a>, a podcast hosting platform. My partner, Jon, and I have three employees. We think we've built something pretty special, and our customers think so too:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <span style="color:pink">‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</span><br>
      "Transistor is hands-down the best podcast hosting! You can host multiple podcasts easily, and get great help/support getting your podcast syndicated on all the major platforms (apple, spotify, etc). Creating unlimited podcasts is great, you only really pay extra if your podcast is a hit (which seems really fair!) Highly recommended!"

    <h2>Web projects I've built</h2>
    <p>Here are a few examples of my work on the web.</p>

    <h3>Transistor web site</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=justin">transistor.fm</a><br>
      <strong>Skills used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DevOps, SEO, marketing<br>
      <strong>Tech stack:</strong> Laravel, PHP, Statamic CMS, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js
    </p>
    <img src="transistor-website-podcast-hosting-by-justin-jackson.jpg" alt="Transistor website design and build by Justin Jackson" />
    <p>We had our original website built on top of WordPress. I to build a new version of the site using <a href="https://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> as the CMS.</p>
     <p>I built the whole thing in public, and often livestreamed my coding sessions. I published progress updates and tutorials on my <a href="https://youtube.com/justinjackson">YouTube channel</a>:</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri67SK3Qowk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>This project illustrated some of my strengths:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Building in public</strong>: by livestreaming and sharing video updates, I was able to get people interested in the overall project. Lots of folks showed up to watch my progress, which brought more awareness to the Transistor brand.</li>
      <li><strong>Getting help from the greater community</strong>: the other benefit of working in the open was many web developers showed up to help me as I worked through different roadblocks. At the time, our startup didn't have a lot of money to hire outside help, so this was a creative way to pair program with people who could help.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Write and Destroy</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://writeanddestroy.com/">writeanddestroy.com</a><br>
      <strong>Skills used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DevOps<br>
      <strong>Open source project:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mijustin/stresswriter">GitHub</a>
    </p>

    <p>Many therapists recommend that their patients write out their thoughts, feelings, and experiences on paper. Then, they recommend burning or shredding the paper. </p>
    <p>I wanted to re-create this experience, but digitally.</p>
    <p>This is a simple web app that allows you to write out your feelings, thoughts, and anxieties and then "shred" them.</p>

    <h3>This is a web page</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">justinjackson.ca/words.html</a><br>
      <strong>Skills used:</strong> HTML, publicity<br>
      <strong>Open source project:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mijustin/stresswriter">GitHub</a>
    </p>

    <p>This is by far the most popular thing I‚Äôve made. I was reminiscing about the simplicity of the early web, and wrote it in a fit of inspiration.</p>
    <p>It's now been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, and has been translated into 29 different languages by readers.</p>
