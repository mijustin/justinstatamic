    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Why pick Basecamp over Highrise?</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color:#CCC; padding: 5px;">
    <strong>To: Potential 37signals customer</strong><br />
    <strong>Subject: What's the difference between Basecamp and Highrise?</strong>
    <p>Thanks for your interest in our products. Choosing between Basecamp and Highrise depends on what you need to &quot;get done&quot; in your business.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for software to manage your projects, I would recommend  Basecamp. Basecamp allows you to organize deadlines, to-do lists,  messages and files in one place. Furthermore, the ability to collaborate with your team and clients is built in. You can take a tour of Basecamp here: http://basecamphq.com/tour</p>
    <p>Highrise is a great choice if you are looking to manage your contacts. This software will help you keep track of the notes, emails and phone conversations you have with your customers. You can also keep an eye on sales leads and potential contracts. For examples of how this works, we have a video tour here: http://highrisehq.com/#videos/guided_tour</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">Do you have Gantt charts in Basecamp?</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color:#CCC; padding: 5px;">
    <strong>To: 37signals customer</strong><br />
    <strong>Subject: I can't find Gantt charts in Basecamp</strong>
    <p>Thanks for trying out Basecamp to manage your projects. While we don't have Gantt charts, we do have a Milestones feature that achieves similar purpose. Milestones allow you to schedule the major deadlines for your project, and assign responsibility to members on your team. You can get an overview of all these tasks on the Milestones calendar (which you can also import into Google Calendar, Outlook, Backpack, .Mac, and iCal).</p>
    <p>Another thing I've really enjoyed about using Milestones is having the ability to assign project messages, to-do lists, and comments to that particular milestone.</p>
    <p>If you need help on how you might manage a specific project using Milestones, please email me back with the details. I would be happy help. You can also watch this video overview: http://basecamphq.com/demos/milestones</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;">I'd like a Jobs Board refund</h2>
    <blockquote style="background-color:#CCC; padding: 5px;">
    <strong>To: 37signals customer</strong><br />
    <strong>Subject: The Job Board didn't work, I'd like a refund</strong>
    <p>Thank you for using Job Board to list your job posting. I'm sorry to hear it didn't work for you, and that you couldn't find a suitable candidate.</p>
    <p>Just like other advertising platforms, we don't offer refunds for job postings that have already been run. We feel we've built the best Job Board possible, but we can't guarantee success with every ad.</p>
    <p>I hope that you will try us again in the future. If you do, you might find this guide helpful (it was written by Matt, here in our office): https://37signals.com/svn/posts/586-writing-better-help-wanted-ads</p>
