<h2>The newsletter for product people</h2>
    <p>Trying to build and launch your own digital product?</p>
<script src="https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/793.js?orient=horz"></script>

<p>
The newsletter is sent every Saturday morning. You'll get lessons and essays on building digital products, marketing, and discovering what customers <em>really</em> want.</p>

<p>I've been there, learned some lessons the hard way, and found success. I want to share those lessons with you.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-910" style="border-radius: 100%; margin: 10px;" src="http://justinjackson.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/justin-jackson-smile-barber-500x500.jpg" alt="justin-jackson-smile-barber" width="200" height="200" /><p>Hi, I'm Justin Jackson.</p>
<p>
I've been building things with computers since 1985. I was a BBS SysOp at age 12. I sold my first product in the 10th grade. I built my first website in 1993. Now, I'm the Product Manager for a profitable web app, and the host of the <a href="http://productpeople.tv">Product People</a> podcast. <strong>I'm passionate about building products that delight customers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I live in <a href="http://vernonliving.tumblr.com">Vernon, BC</a> with my wife and 4 kids. (Yes, I said 4). For fun, I ride bikes, snowboard, and drink fine beer (sometimes all at the same time).
</p>
